# nlp_in_spark
In this project, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was performed in Spark using the spark-MLlib library.

This project consists of the ipython notebook SparkMLlib_Word2vec.ipynb which contains the code for processing and modeling the dataset movie_reviews.csv, also shared in files. The reviews in the dataset are preprocessed, assigned labels, embedded and then employed for modeling conventional machine learning models.

The 2 embedding models from the gensim library of python have been compared, namely Word2Vec and FastText in SparkMLlib_Word2vec.ipynb and SparkMLlib_Fasttext.ipynb respectively.

A detailed exlaination of this process is presented in the post [here](https://medium.com/@mrunmayee.dhapre/natural-language-processing-nlp-with-spark-python-f67ac513616f)
