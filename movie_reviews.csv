21 Jump Street,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There wasn't a dull moment throughout the entire film as it had a perfect blend of comedy, emotion and humor. Aside from the humorous aspects, the movie also highlights the strong bond and friendship between two individuals with diverse personalities and skills. They manage to conquer their fears and insecurities to attain their objectives, despite their differences. It's an excellent movie overall and I hope upcoming movies will be just as good as this one. This film brings back memories from the 2010s.",4.5

21 Jump Street,"21 Jump Street is a funny movie. It's so wacky, goofy, and stupid, but damn, is it hilarious! I love the concept of two cops undercover as high school students, where the two cops used to bully and be bullied by one another. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum kill their roles and are very funny. Dave Franco also plays a very funny role. I thought his character was actually the funniest characters in the movie. There are also many action scenes that are thrilling AND hilarious. I believe the film does an excellent job of balancing action and comedy. It's definitely a great movie that's worth watching.",3.5

The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"The story and plot was very good and somewhat funny, the acting was pretty good, and the characters were ok. This movie was way too long. Could have been over half an hour shorter and it would have had a better rating from me. It just dragged on for so long that by the time he had sex you were already tired from the movie and now it wasn't hyped enough anymore.",3.0
The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"A Classic Comedy Movie. The acting is solid overall. I felt some supporting cast were more forced at times than others though with the joke delivery and no one I felt was Leslie Neilson in Naked Gun level funny. The music is really good also. This is really well paced overall and keeps the jokes coming at a good steady pace and consistently gets a chuckle and a good laugh here and there. The best was the wax scene. The editing is really good also. This does a great job mixing a sex comedy with a romance story overall. The only real issues is sometimes in the middle it feels like sex gags just kind of happen without a real flow to it and it would be one thing if they were LOL funny but not for just chuckles. It does at times in the middle because of that start to drag just a bit. The tender romance moments are really well done and ironically besides the wax scene, the strongest points of the film. If it would've dialed back some of the unneeded humor in the middle it would be amazing. The cinematography is really good also. The only real issue while there are plenty of solid visual gags, sometimes it just gets into ""Mean"" style humor like racist jokes which are a little out of place for a sex comedy. These aren't as funny as the witty dialogue ones as they drag quite a bit and aren't really visual joke based. The camerawork is basic also but the settings are memorable surprisingly. Anyone who is a fan of comedies, Rom-Coms, or any actors in this will like his a lot.",4.5
The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"A redemption comedy about a 40 year old virgin, who basically gets terrible advice from people who mean well but probably shouldn't have injected themselves into his love life (or lack of rather). Some really funny scenes and a sweet ending that shows the rebirth of this man. The comedy is centered around his coworkers advice to try to lead him into his first physical relationship. A funny and original movie which is surprisingly rare in modern comedy",5.0
The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"A comedic submersion with Steve Carell at its heart. For such a clear-cut narrative, this film delivers. You are heavily invested in the fortunes of Andy's story and you're really rooting for the guy. Not much else to say, but if you're looking to have a fun time, this is a great film.",4.5
The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"Bit on the long side for such a formulaic film, but its heart is in the right place. Some good jokes, but a lot of 'cursing is funny, right?' too. Andy's got an unrealistic amount of game for a khv though.",3.0
The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"Steve Carrell, Seth Rogen y Paul Rudd son posiblemente los 3 artistas que mejor plantean el humor negro en su contenido, ya sea Steve Carrell en ‚ÄòThe Office', Seth Rogen en ‚ÄòThis is the End' (Una pel√≠cula que siento que toma muchas cosas prestadas de esta) y un Paul Rudd que aunque sea m√°s calmado que ellos 2 tambi√©n ha regalado joyas c√≥mo ‚ÄòUn Par Nada Ejemplar', pero me parece que todos supieron explotar ese humor tan rebelde gracias a la adicci√≥n de Judd Apatow tanto en la direcci√≥n c√≥mo en el guion; un director de inicios de siglo con un humor tan distinguido de esta √©poca que me parece que hasta hoy sigue inspirando proyectos, con pel√≠culas como ‚ÄòHazme Re√≠r' de 2007 o con un Cine m√°s complejo c√≥mo ‚ÄòEl Arte de Ser Adulto' del reci√©n 2020; estas 4 personas sab√≠an lo que quer√≠an plantear en esta pel√≠cula.

Virgen a los 40 en la superficialidad podr√° ser una pel√≠cula visualmente y verbalmente explicita, pero me parece que en su interior plantea una historia que habla de la aceptaci√≥n de uno mismo en una sociedad que de cierta manera te obliga a cambiar para pertenecer a cierto grupo o para juntarte con ciertas personas; pero a la vez cimentando una dualidad d√≥nde si te encierras en tu caparaz√≥n tambi√©n te pierdes de cosas de la vida que realmente valen la pena. Vistas desde el POV de Andy, que en su evoluci√≥n de personaje de manera muy literal se enfrenta a esto, el se propone a experimentar cosas nuevas porque realmente lo necesita, el primer acto de la pel√≠cula te plantea lo mon√≥tona que es su vida, para en un 2 y 3 acto tambi√©n plantear que el dejar de ser t√∫ mismo para ""encajar"" es quedarte sin identidad. Algo de lo que Andy se da cuenta en la parte clim√°tica de la cinta, en la que entiende que el cambio no siempre es malo, pero sin traicionar al antiguo yo, entendiendo que la clave est√° en aceptarse uno mismo y que tan simple como suena las dem√°s personas tambi√©n te aceptar√°n, c√≥mo los amigos del trabajo de Andy que por suerte o como sea terminaron saliendo con √©l para darse cuenta que es una persona que realmente vale la pena y que es m√°s del estereot√≠pico adulto que a sus 40 sigue coleccionando figuras  y lo mismo pasa con Trish, se da cuenta que Andy es feliz como es, y que no necesita ""madurar"" para lograrse c√≥mo persona, no necesita renunciar a lo que realmente le llena como podr√≠a ser algo tan superficial c√≥mo sus figuras o algo m√°s personal c√≥mo es su trabajo. Y para mi es lo que hace a esta pel√≠cula diferente detr√°s de la comedia plantea una historia que realmente vale la pena ser o√≠da tambi√©n. Andy es un personaje que al tener tantas dudas y e inseguridades no se da cuenta de que es una gran persona. Sin darse cuenta que no se le dificulta hacer amigos, lo mismo en conseguir citas, el realmente es m√°s interesante de lo que cree. Pero muchas veces ese bloqueo existencial de nosotros mismos no nos deja ver qui√©nes somos realmente.

La direcci√≥n realmente es muy b√°sica, aunque me parece que involuntariamente esta simpleza visual se convirti√≥ en una carta de amor a los inicios de los 2000. Aunque la pel√≠cula m√°s de una vez tenga cortes extra√±os que rompen la continuidad de la trama. Aunque al final siento que es lo que le da coraz√≥n a esta narrativa. Esta pel√≠cula cumple su objetivo de contar una historia simplista que no es aburrida.

Virgen a los 40 logra contar una historia de un humor negro incre√≠ble con un sub di√°logo con una historia m√°s personal.",3.0

The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"It had been many years since I last saw this raunchy comedy, with more heart to the story than most from that era, and the cast has seemed to grow even more robust in the interim.

This may not have aged as well for some but I found myself still laughing more than a few times at many of the comedic performances and sophomoric humor. Steve Carrell is perfectly cast in the titular role and the supporting roles feature too many familiar faces putting in excellent work to list them all.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"Back in 1994, Jim Carrey took Hollywood by storm with three box-office hits that put the actor on the map forever. One of those movies was Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, a whodunit spoof with Carrey playing an anarchic pet detective who finds himself being forced into tackling a murder case.

The film was a big success and spawned a sequel plus an animated series. This was arguably mostly thanks to Jim Carrey's excellent physical comedy in the film (speaking through his butt and such) and the Ace Ventura character himself. The plot involves a dolphin called Snowflake, the mascot for NFL team The Miami Dolphins, being kidnapped just before The Super Bowl. The aforementioned pet detective is called in to take on the case before a murder is committed that turns out to be very much connected to the dolphin case. It becomes up to Ace Ventura to not only track down the missing animal but step on the police's toes in order to solve the killing.

Along the way, he stakes out each and every player from the NFL team, the family of a suspect, a suspicious billionaire played by Udo Kier, goes undercover in a mental institution and other shenanigans. Sean Young plays the police lieutenant who clashes with Ace Ventura throughout the movie and she is a very good sport considering what she's asked to do by the end of the film. Now, the elephant in the room here is, of course, how the movie hasn't dated particularly well when it comes to dealing with a story that involves mental illness and a character changing their gender. Indeed, the film is decidedly insensitive about these things, playing everything for laughs, which is to be expected, but it's also not handled in a particularly funny way. Ultimately, the film's climax comes off as awkward and a bit too homophobic for its own good.

In fact, there was always a tonal mismatch in this film and re-watching it really made it stand out to me. Ace Ventura is a fun character and the childish humor, in his hands, is rather charming but the film itself seems confused whether it wants to be a dark serial killer movie or a family-friendly comedy. In the end, it attempts both at the same time and the vibe is overall a bit too mean-spirited to be a laugh riot the whole way through. There are some highlights, however: the opening home delivery sequence is just perfect, the Mission: Impossible parody is a lot of fun, Carrey's Star Trek impressions, his tutu-wearing hospital antics, brutal encounter with a shark - it's good stuff. Ace Ventura's obnoxious behavior is refreshingly out there and the supporting cast is genuinely good so there's plenty to enjoy here.

The character of Ace Ventura is much better handled in the more cartoonish sequel Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, which has a consistent tone throughout the film and, thankfully, keeps things light but, most importantly, is a lot funnier. There are laughs here, no doubt about it, and Jim Carrey alone makes it a film worth watching but the vision here is frankly unclear and a little off.

Adam's Rib,"It was absolutely painful to watch. The screaming, fighting, violence, and threatened violence both emotional and physical was a chore to sit through. The ending was implausible but typically Hollywood. The Kip character was a nightmare.
That said, the acting was great among the secondary characters, and the Tracey-Hepburn chemistry was intense. I truly wonder what audiences experienced back in the era.",1.5
Adam's Rib,"One of the AFI top ten romantic films (somehow). A lighthearted look at a miscarriage of justice that is meant to be some kind of ribald comedy about gender prejudice but misses the target entirely. Not funny or entertaining, it nowadays feels like a drag to watch. Bought this one on DVD as not on the or streaming in the UK.",1.0
Adam's Rib,Probably the best Tracy-Hepburn film.,4.5
Adam's Rib,"This Cukor directed rom com re-teams Tracy and Hepburn with an extremely well written script, elements that together help overcome a somewhat shallow and predictable plot.

One can't help but wonder if a lot of the strength in this script about a husband and wife having their professional and home lives converge comes as a result of the writer's, Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, real life marriage.

Katherine Hepburn was easily my favorite to watch, in a role tackling themes that seem far less progressive over 70 years later, while sadly still easily recognizable as well.

This likely won't offer anyone a transformational experience but can still provide a satisfying watch as we witness two extremely compatible, top tier, actors working with the sort of script that only accentuates their strengths.

NYT 1000 #279",3.5
Adam's Rib,"""First of all, I should like to say at the outset that I think that the arguments advanced by the consel for the defense were sound. Mere sound.""

Any film that bases itself on gender roles is going to age a bit with time, as the social politics will naturally evolve to the point where the dynamics aren't exactly up to date; when you're going through jury selection and potential jurors unironically and confidently express that they are against equalt treatment of the sexes, it gives the viewers a bit of a pause as to just how much different the world of George Cukor is from that of today. What themes today seem obvious were likely considered preachy, overzealous, and an attack on American values by many audience members in 1949 (and if they weren't outraged by Katherine Hepburn extolling the need for gender equality, the presence of a black man on the jury probably sent them over the edge). Despite Cukor's esteem there is a noticeable bit of irregularity in the directing, with a small handful of the longer, dialogue-heavy scenes allowing a couple of flubs in line delivery. While you could nitpick parts of gender role treatment of the film until the cows come home, it's easier to appreciate a solid romcom with good chemistry between its leads and a well-constructed sense of comedy and social progressivism.

Rom-com involving two lawyers that are assigned to the same case; prosecuting and criminal defense.

Writing, directing, editing are all well done. Easy to watch and much comedic moments; I'd guess 10-20 good laughs. Length of movie is perfect. Katharine plays a semi-strong, witty feminist, while Spencer plays the angry sexist. There is no violence between the couple, which I can appreciate.

"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert","""I've said it before and I'll say it again: no more fucking ABBA.""

Not just a highly impactful film for its welcoming and outright celebratory depiction of drag queens and transsexual characters, Priscilla is both a downright hilarious and pretty damn quotable road comedy as well as a solid exploration of identity and a personal retrospective, all balled up into one delightful package. I personally grew up knowing all three members of this trio (Stamp, Weaving, and Pearce) from completely different types of material, which made the way each of them disappears into their respective characters all the more impressive and enjoyable; Stamp with his no-nonsense tone and dismissive, snappy dialogue was a particular treat. The film places the three lip syncers in a bus through the outback while mixing them together in enough of a cocktail of confrontation, inter-group drama, jokes, and personal growth to make you feel involved with the characters through the comedy and drama alike. If the film had decided to go down a more pained route with excessive pushback by the bogans or a lack of family support, it would come off as far less sincere; instead, we get sold on the entertainment and pleasantly surprised by the camraderie. 

It's tough to discuss a film so influential in establishing mainstream acceptance of LGBTQ cinema without mentioning the surprising inclusion of Cynthia, a Filipina woman who seems straight out of a particularly bad Family Guy cutaway gag. In a story that focuses on breaking down preconceptions about stigmatized groups, her opportunistic and vulgar traits seem a bit callous, yes, but I'm willing to give the creative team the benefit of the doubt and say her design was not so much intended to be harmful as it was just poorly thought-out. 

I imagine the Wachowski siblings in 1994 seeing a transgender Hugo Weaving character in a surprisingly successful Australian road comedy-drama with lines like, ""my tits are falling down,"" and turning to each other with a simultaneous ""he's perfect."" (4/5)",4.0
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert","Featuring a trio of fantastic central performances, and a sensitive supporting one from Bill Hunter, Priscilla, QOTD is a frequently hilarious romp into the vast Australian Outback, exploring issues of identity, intolerance and acceptance. The dialogue feels so natural because its exactly the kind of thing you might hear from a group of friends on a road trip, slinging good-natured abuse at each other, with the occasional sharper insult thrown in here and there. I've heard it said that in the past few decades, gay people weren't written very well, at least not written like actual, 3 dimensional characters. It was simply a case that their homosexuality was the sum total of their personality, like it was the only thing that distinguished them. Here, our 3 leads are distinct characters, with heir own flaws and quirks, and their orientation and lifestyle is what unites them, rather than defines them. Our leads experience all kinds of different reactions to their lifestyle, ranging from confusion to hostility and indifference to celebration. A lesser film would just have had everybody spewing homophobia remarks towards them wherever they went, and it would have made for repetitive, depressing viewing. On a separate note, as someone who lived in Australia for close to 2 years, I was glad to see how well the film captured not only the country's staggering natural beauty, but also its unbelievable size and desolation. Overall, it's a very entertaining story filled with both warmth and humour. It's a milestone in LGBTQ+ cinema, and has an entertaining plot to go along with its important message.",4.0

Airplane!,"Spoofs, parodies and pastiches were hardly new to cinema when Airplane was released in 1980. Still most of the movies in this category tended to mock broader outlines of earlier films. This changed in 1980 when three comedians decided to make a movie that existed largely to make fun of scenes in popular movies, some of them reproduced in loving detail. Those comedians were the brothers David and Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams.

Airplane spoofs a number of other films including Jaws, From Here to Eternity, and Saturday Night Fever. More particularly it was aimed at the 1970s airplane disaster movies such as Airport and its many sequels. However the single film that most inspired ZAZ (as the writers are called for short) was a now-forgotten movie made in 1957 called Zero Hour.

Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack and Leslie Nielsen, all wooden, tight-lipped, and humourless actors were somehow persuaded to appear in a film that mocked the kind of acting performances out of which they had made a good living for many years.

Airplane represented a different kind of comedy movie altogether (insert obvious Airplane joke). It is hardly a movie so much as an anti-movie. Everything in the movie is designed to service the jokes. Consistency of storyline, characterisation and continuity are sacrificed in pursuit of making the audience laugh. The actors have no chance to emote or impress. All that counts is comic delivery. Even Elmer Bernstein's music score is at the service of the comedy, providing a mock-heroic background to the absurd actions.

All About My Mother,Hermosa y conmovedora,4.0
All About My Mother,"All About My Mother represented another stage in the development of Pedro Almodovar as a film director. His early films are marked by a more outrageously camp style. The humour is over-the top, the morality perverse, and the style kitsch.

However over time, Almodovar's style began to mature from his independent beginnings, and his films began to deal with more serious matter. All About My Mother was certainly not the first of Almodovar's films to explore this new seriousness, but it was the best movie that he had made up until that point. He may have subsequently exceeded it with Talk to Her and Volver.

Many of the trappings of the typical Almodovar film are here. The colours are bright and vibrant. The d√©cor is gaudier than the kind that you see in most people's houses. The style is theatrical, with traditional Spanish songs, old movies and scenes from plays thrown in, complete with stage curtains descending at the beginning and end of the movie.

The film is populated by typical Almodovar characters ‚Äì fighting lesbians, a pregnant nun with HIV, and a few transgender prostitutes.  However these comfortingly familiar Almodovar touches are only little camp frills here. The story could have been told more plainly without any of them, although if it had been, then it would not have been an Almodovar movie.

These elements are inseparable from Almodovar's style, but the film has serious and universal themes too. It deals with the pain of loss, and confrontation with one's own past. What follows is a sad tale that its ironies, catty witticisms and startling dialogue cannot detract from.

If you would like to read more of my views on All About My Mother, I wrote a blog (possibly containing spoilers), which can be found at: https://themoviescreenscene.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/all-about-my-mother-1999/",5.0
All About My Mother,The best movie ever made. Ever.,5.0
All About My Mother,"This film has quite a laidback feel to it, with slow jazz type music playing in the background at times. Its an interesting, thoughtful perhaps watch. There are numerous sex references present, so unsurprisingly it isn't an ideal watch if your watching with your parents or similar but that's to be expected. It features a good cast (including Cecilia Roth and Penelope Cruz) and I liked the cinematography, showing the seedier sides of Barcelona. The plot intrigued me - its certainly a good bit of social commentary, Given the plot, it may have been, if only somewhat, controversial when it came out in the late 1990s and I respect that its a well liked and regarded films. As ever with Almodovar's films, bright colours plays a big part in this.

I liked and respected that the women looked out for each other. I suppose it has the feel of a play about it - indeed a play is part of the storyline but the whole film could be a theatrical production, I feel. I thought it was at times poignant and also somewhat amusing, due to the sharp dialogue.
I certainly enjoyed watching it, so yes, I'd recommend it.",4.0
All About My Mother,"A very heartfelt outing from Almod√≥var explores humanity in the wake of tragedy. Deeply humanizing to its array of female and LGBTQ characters, I enjoyed Todo Sobre Mi Madre, although it was more serious than I expected it to be, without some of the lightness often brought to the table by Almod√≥var's customary campiness.",4.0
All About My Mother,"Pedro Almodovar delivers, what he describes in his own words as, a screwball drama that features many uniquely captivating female characters in a film he dedicates to ""actresses who played actresses"".

The plot may prove too melodramatic for some but I am usually down for the big, loud, over the top plot devices and characters, especially when paired with such gorgeous cinematography and an eye dazzlingly stimulating color palette.

Cecilia Roth provides a solid foundation as most of the action and character introductions come about as a result of passing through her orbit. Penelope Cruz creates some impressively nuanced pathos in a role that became more interesting as the story progressed. It was Antonia San Juan however, who almost stole this show with her Algrado, as her performance offered the largest range, providing plenty of humorous banter interspersed between moments that felt far too genuine for a fictitious film plot.

I had intended to dig into Almodovar's work much more quickly after Parallel Mothers, early this year, and Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown which I saw, and loved, shortly after. With yet another winner from him I know I will be actively seeking out more of his work in the future.

On a side note I got a kick out of the fact this was listed, as it is alphabetical, right behind All About Eve in the New York Times Book of Movies that I am currently working through. I would also recommend giving A Streetcar Named Desire a rewatch before this as that production is prominently featured in All About My Mother. 7.5/10

All About My Mother,"""I used to be a truck driver ... in Paris, before I got my tits.""

An interesting blend, featuring irreverent characters, subplots that border on soap opera territory, and copious humor, but presented in a way that is intended to convey close friendships and emotional vulnerability rather than simple entertainment value. Deeply reverential of classic source material and using a Sirk film most prominently, Almod√≥var has no qualms about expressing his love for the melodramatic, but instead of leaning towards pulp he opts for a more humane interpretation that feels uplifting, particularly in the face of personal tragedy. Solid scriptwork and a constantly moving plot keep the audience attentive, and the color palette makes the visuals just as engrossing as the story. Not necessarily a film that speaks to my own experiences, but one that can be appreciated by many.  (3.5/5)",3.5
All About My Mother,"A very Almod√≥var film, the way the iconic director brings together a group of completely different characters, each colourful and interesting in their own way, to tell a story that is full of such humanity never fails to impress me.

All About My Mother,"Relying on its melodramatic strength, affectingly poignant score and sumptuous colour palette, the movie goes full force right off the bat towards its core concept driving the story forward, relentlessly pulling at heartstrings and leaving us completely choked up. Then, it seems to abandon what it set up and liberates itself, only to unveil, little by little, its rich and intricate tapestry of femininity and maternity. Through a growing web of female characters, All About My Mother celebrates female solidarity as we see each one shows right in time to rescue the other from the brink of collapse by creating emotional bonds between one another to fill in each other's gaps and get each others to complement their missing halves. Stupendous performances from all around, but I was struck, in particular, by Cecilia Roth's bravura performance as the lead character Manuela. The emotional range she shows is impressive and the entire movie she seems as if her eyes locked in tears, ready to fall anytime her son is brought up in any conversation. These scenes show how inextricably linked her complex feelings of haunting grief are, as she mourns Esteban's death and her being bereft of maternity at the same time. All About My Mother is also a panorama of vivid colours and moments of 'joie de vivre' that keep the film light on its feet while bolstering its tribute to actresses as well as its female spirit. Crazy how All About My Mother winds up giving perfect closure to the relationships between the characters and the themes it explores after getting carried away a bit too far now and then.",4.5
All About My Mother,"This was probably the most LGBT-friendly movie I've ever seen and I'm glad to have watched it. The acting was top-notch, particularly from the lesser-known Cecilia Roth & Marisa Paredes, who I'd never heard of before but were very effective conveying their intended emotions. The subject matter was excellent, the sympathetic treatment given to the trans characters was awesome and the allusions to All About Eve were appreciable. I did have some trouble with the subtitles, not because I wasn't paying attention but because HBO Max puts them in tiny un-adjustable font with a non-opaque background that made it nearly impossible to follow along when anything on the screen was white, like the hospital scenes & a few others. It was still a good viewing experience and clearly a great movie!",3.5

While the film almost feels too short to deal in depth with all of the intriguing characters, it remains a touching comment on the importance of compassion and acceptance.

All About My Mother,"Pedro Almod√≥var's luscious, poignant, and humane film All About My Mother; sits as a vibrant ode to the classic women-led melodramatic films which flourished within the male-dominated period of Hollywood cinema. Though its connected nature works as a stylistic choice, the film still manages to ""wear it all on its sleeve."" The female characters in All About My Mother not only have individual agency but also come together within a series of life-affirming circumstances like bonding, identity, loss, and grief -- all brought visually to life by Almod√≥var. His early filmography including Labyrinth of Passion (Almod√≥var, 1982), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Almod√≥var, 1988) and Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (Almod√≥var, 1990) tended to explore sexuality, drama, pop d√©cor, and were all directed with a visually distinctive approach by their director. 

However, in comparison, Almod√≥var's most celebrated Oscar-winning feature acts as a mature steppingstone in his work. He approaches his subjects and themes previously with an almost comical sense of anarchy, which overall passes here for a reflective piece. The characters registered in Almod√≥var's unique mind are relatable, caring, flawed, powerful, but still delightfully quirky and real within the space of the film. The film begins with the central protagonist Manuela (Roth). She loses her son, Esteban (Azor√≠n) in a tragic car accident after chasing down a taxi containing famed actress, Huma (Paredes) aiming to get her autograph after watching her in a stage play of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Subsequently, after the transplant of her son's heart, Manuela falls apart, leaving prostitution to find his estranged, trans father, Lola (Cant√≥). Along the way she reconnects with an old friend, another transgender prostitute named Agrado (Juan) and, Rosa (Cruz). Rosa, a Nun whose role is to shelter sex workers and has a crucial connection to Lola, and also to the actress Huma. Her story unfolds like that of a troubled friend to her co-star Nina (Pe√±a) who has a dependency on heroin. 

All the character strands that connect with Manuela work not only as a character drama but as a textual drama as well; the visual references to A Streetcar Named Desire, Manuela and Esteban sitting down to watch All About Eve (Mankiewicz, 1950) and its main story arc, evokes that heavily. Manuela relies on the kindness of friends and strangers, and they return this in turn too. Almod√≥var approaches the material with his emphatic and visceral directorial hand but allows these central characters to equally be funny and thought-provoking. It is primarily a caring film that actively refuses to pass judgement on these human frailties or view their consequences as cautionary tales but rather treats them with compassion. The character of Agrado, a transgender former truck driver-turned sex worker, is not solely defined here by her circumstances. Instead, Agrado sets out to deconstruct the prejudiced viewpoints of trans-identity, embracing the things which define her alone instead of by typically preconceived notions; a contemporary and daring feat of trans-positive identity representation by Almod√≥var.

Also, an actress that possesses comic chops that can rival that of the classic comedy stars like Gilda Radnor or Madeline Kahn. In a career-defining performance, Penelope Cruz's Rosa, who becomes HIV positive after a relationship with Manuela's former lover Lola ‚Äì sees within Manuela, Agrado, and Huma, their humanity, and gains happiness in their respective companies.
Almod√≥var is showcased here as a director who has reached a peak of emotional heights. In a career that constructed film stories and featured subject matters which are tonally archaic, frank and button-pushing. All About My Mother wants its audience, to listen, to take in and to fully experience these characters occupying a space which feels authentic and true. It is a film that takes its time, relishes, and acknowledges its classic Hollywood genre label, but importantly, Almod√≥var has his particular voice to register. Within the movie works of Bette Davis, Huma considers her an inspiration; and it is Almod√≥var that clearly wishes not only to utilise and celebrate her wide and appreciated body of work but also, in turn, homage, pastiche and embrace it together via this role. 

An emotional, heartfelt, and sumptuously designed piece of pure melodrama in the best sense. While we are all currently enduring a timely period of political divide and intolerance, the works of Spain's most appealing, enduring and above all graceful directors, was, and still is needed evermore. The film's closes with this line; ‚ÄòTo all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who can act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother.'

The editing isn't bad considering the story is pretty basic and there is a lot of characters. This also moves very fast and is actually a well paced film right out of the gate and sets the plot up in 7 minutes and tone. The message is a bit hypocritical, being a teen is not just about sex but than it is because they all get laid in the end....but it does have some charm overall.

This movie has so many LOL moments, but also some sad moments too that make you feel bad for Ron Burgandy, like the time when he lost his job, or when Jack Black (Tenacious D, Mario Movie, Goosebumps) kicks Ron Burgendys dog  Baxter off a bridge. All in all this movie is a masterpiece, and definitely one of my favorites.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"Ridiculous, hilarious and endlessly quotable, ""Anchorman"" is a modern-day classic comedy. The movie is full of in-your-face moments and shocking quips, all supported by a stellar cast. Though a little over-the-top at times, this film is a lesson on subjectivity in comedy. The script seemed to be non-existent as improv was king during filming.

I don't know that I would love this movie as much had I not seen it when I was a teenager. Nostalgia and quotability are some of the strongest elements of ""Anchorman"". Some of the scenes were so absurd that they made me take a step back and say, ""What in the world just happened?"" (i.e., the conch shell).

Annie Hall,"This one is a mixed bag for me.  As others have stated on here, the structure is great, you have various skit scenes including an animated scene.  It has your usual Woody opening where his younger self gets into shenanigans.  The problem is I couldn't care less about the leads at all and the ending just happened with no real oompf.  Woody's endless talking also grates toward the end and the film drags even for only a 90-minute runtime.  Fans of Woody will love this one though although I fail to see how it ever won any awards.",2.5

Annie Hall,"There is no agreement about Allen's best movie, but it is probably less controversial to say that Annie Hall is his most important film. Indeed many would think Annie Hall is his best as well. It is certainly his most popular. A number of scenes are fondly remembered ‚Äì Allen chasing escaped lobsters around his kitchen, or blowing away an expensive purchase of cocaine with an ill-timed sneeze.

While Allen was disappointed with the film, thinking that it did not turn out as he had hoped, the public thought otherwise Annie Hall was his most fourth most successful film at the box office, and secured Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. It was also the only film where Allen's acting secured an Oscar nomination.

The importance of Annie Hall lies in its pivotal role in Allen's directing and writing career. This was the turning point where he moved from making films that were pure comedies to producing cinema that sacrificed some of the humour, and had a more serious intent, and greater artistry. This is not to say that Annie Hall is not a very funny movie. It is. However Allen was aiming for something more than making audiences feel good.

The film throws in references to Freud, Wagner, Sylvia Plath, Fellini, Balzac and others with a gleeful relish. There is no attempt to dumb down for the viewer's sake, and Allen is happy to make a movie where conversation matters more than action.  Indeed there is enough content in Annie Hall to fill several movies, but here it is all rolled into one. This is the work of a moviemaker brimming with ideas.

Annie Hall,"Allen's turning point. Annie Hall (1977) is the beginning and the first act of a new way to make movies, in particular in the romantic and comedy genre, which will be the trademark of Allen's filmography, in his dual role of director and protagonist. The movie indeed tells the story of a breakup from Alvy Singer's point of view, and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton); he traces at the same time the story of their relationship and of his life. Through his ironic, sharp and selfish eyes, the protagonist takes us into his everyday life by reviewing both the little and the big things, such as queuing for a movie or killing a spider on the one hand and realising that the girl you left by mutual agreement, who you criticized over and over, was the right one on the other hand. Due to a brilliant screenplay, accompanied by a montage that keeps up the ryhthm, the movie never loses its thread and offers some of the most beautiful and romantic scenes ever made (it's impossible to write them all down). Remarkable the cameos of Paul Simon, Christopher Walken and Shelley Duvall. Oscar for the original screenplay, actress in a leading role (Diane Keaton), best picture, best directing.",5.0

Annie Hall,"As with almost every Woody Allen picture, he is playing himself, showing us a glimpse into his life. For better or worse, it's an hour of flagellation and patting his own persona. This is very specific humor that, in my experience, will either annoy you or cause you to miss the highbrow references Allen is throwing at you, as in Love and Death, for example. Aside from that, his films, or rather his experiences, should either resonate with you or once again irritate you, as you gradually start to hate the character. Annie Hall is probably the most universally liked of all of his repertoire. Due to the acting and inventive and well-edited scenes. Growing comfortable with your own happiness and eventually stopping, appreciating it, and only realizing what you have done once it's gone is immensely relatable. Especially in the way that Allen frames it. It is not some kind of pompous tragedy. It's just another microcosm of life. And as the final frame suggests, for him it's the most painful separation of his life, but for anyone else it's just a view from a window.",3.5
Annie Hall,"Poignant, humorous, innovative---""Annie Hall"" is that rare kind of movie that gets better the more you see it.  Diane Keaton is superb as the heroine who grows up as we watch, and Woody Allen is his typical nervous, anxious, neurotic persona.  But what I really love about the film is the ways that it breaks down the barriers between itself and audience, the ways it shifts tempos and points of view and time so that we get a stream-of-consciousness recreation of Alvy Singer's greatest love that in spite of everything goes off the rails.",4.5
Annie Hall,"Not everybody will love Woody Allen's humour, some will find him interesting and sharply insightful while others will find him self-indulgent. With me, it veers very largely towards the former with some occasions where the latter does creep in. Annie Hall is one of his best films, a masterpiece and one of the better Best Picture winners of the 70s with only the two Godfather films even better. The best assets are the script and the chemistry between the two leads. The script is enormously witty, with cracking dialogue that induces one and at times more laughs a minute, and full of insightful observations. People have deemed it one of the best screenplays of all time, and from personal perspective there is no reason to argue. The chemistry between the two leads, running somewhat on a parallel between the relationship of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton itself, and the actors in general actually is throughout very believable. It is often adorable and often dynamic. It helps that Diane Keaton gives one of her best and most endearing performances, and while Alvy is not a particularly likable or sympathetic character Woody Allen is similarly great, his looking into the camera and breaking the fourth wall moments were funny. The supporting cast all give spirited performances, especially Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum is memorable as well for one of the film's best and most quotable lines. The romance is sweet and relateable, the ending for me was really moving, but the story doesn't depend on that alone, Allen also muses over topics that were relevant then and that we can see as relevant today as well, he does so in a very thoughtful way. Allen directs with assurance, and while there have been more visually audacious Woody Allen films since Annie Hall it is still cleverly made with the way it's shot, the cartoon images and how we're shown visually what the characters are thinking. There is no music score and in this case that was a good idea, there was more leeway for the relationship between the two lead characters and observations to speak, and that's the same for the deliberate but never tedious pacing. Overall, an outstanding film, one of Allen's best and one of the greatest films of the 70s. People may dislike it for it winning Best Picture over Star Wars(this viewers and many others however think it fully deserved the win), as much as I'll have a fondness for the Star Wars original trilogy and consider it a milestone of its genre it is easy to see out of Star Wars and Annie Hall which is the superior film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",5.0

Events occur that bring them into close proximity to where she realizes that he is a nice loving guy and that she wants to be with him... There are some nice touches. Lemmon's character has a couple characteristics to make him a bit more likable and the moments in which they are getting to know one another are quite good, but in the end this film just doesn't do enough, doesn't say anything deeply profound.

The Apartment,"The Apartment is astounding because it makes me consider how we view actors based on where we arrive in reality. For me, Fred McMurray is the kind Steve Douglas from TV's My Three Sons. For those born before 1960, they probably saw him on that show and wondered how the heel from Double Indemnity and The Caine Mutiny could be trusted around three growing children.

In Billy Wilder's The Apartment, he's Jeff Sheldrake, a man who uses everyone he meets, like lonely C.C. ""Bud"" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) for his apartment and Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) for her body, uncaring when he pushes both of their to the pit of depression and even a suicide attempt by Fran.

Bud is willing to let the rest of the world see him as the villain, as every executive ‚Äî Ray Walston is one of them  ‚Äî uses his home to have dalliances with his secret lovers while he drinks in bars, dreaming of taking home a married woman when all he really wants is the kind of secure love that allows you to sit happily on the couch next to one another and play cards.

There's also a genuine sadness at the heart of this movie, as Wilder and co-writer I.A.L. Diamond based the film on reality, as high-powered agent Jennings Lang was shot by producer Walter Wanger for having an affair with Wanger's wife Joan Bennett. Lang had used a low-level employee's apartment for the affair, just like the film. Diamond also contributed something that had happened to a friend, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to discover that she had committed suicide in his bed.

Back to McMurray. After this was released, women yelled at him in the street, complaining that he had made a filthy movie. One even hit him with her purse. I guess that was the Twitter of 1960.

This may be the best awarded movie we've talked about on this site, as it won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing at the 1960 Oscars. Jack Lemmon may not have won Best Actor, but when Kevin Spacey won that award in 1999 for American Beauty, he dedicated his Oscar to him, as Sam Mendes had the cast watch this movie for inspiration.

Since then, The Apartment has been remade as a musical (Promises, Promises, which played in 1972 and was revived in 2010) and as two Bollywood movies, Raaste Kaa Patthar and Life in a‚Ä¶ Metro.

The amazing thing is that 62 years after this movie was made, it reduced me to tears. It pulled me in and made me care about every single character, even the villain, and the closing scene ‚Äî and that last line! ‚Äî absolutely devastated me.

You can get The Apartment from Kino Lorber either on blu ray or 4K UHD. You'll also get two different audio commentary tracks, one by Joseph McBride, author of Billy Wilder: Dancing on the Edge and the other by film historian Bruce Block. There's also a documentary about the making of the film and another about the art of Jack Lemmon, plus a trailer.",5.0
The Apartment,"Definitely a great movie for it‚Äôs time. The humor and cynicism still carries over to today‚Äôs day and age, though society‚Äôs treatment of women has changed dramatically from the helpless and subservient roles they occupy in this movie.

Jack Lemmon has a unique way about him and I imagine improvised a good bit of his dialogue and body movements. He was fun to watch.",3.5
The Apartment,"This movie is billed as a comedy-  only problem, no laughs.  In fact, the mood is rather dire throughout.  It has a quality cast and direction, but the message is so obvious you don't need 2 hours of depressing scenarios to get it.

Fred MacMurray is convincing as the villain.",3.0

Arsenic and Old Lace,"Arsenic and Old Lace is a cheerful and breezy tale in which the viewer feels assured that nothing terrible will happen, and yet the film is also a black comedy that exposes the insanity, murder and dark secrets that lie hidden behind the veneer of ordinary folksy American values.

Arsenic and Old Lace had its origins in a successful Broadway play by Joseph Kesselring. While the play was still running, the film was held back for two years before it was released. Many of the cast members from the original play were freed to appear in the movie, but not Boris Karloff (much to his disappointment). Raymond Massey had the unenviable task of playing a character who is said to look like Karloff.

The film also had a new lead star, Cary Grant, who was not in the original theatre production. Grant is said to have considered this to be his least favourite movie, feeling that his performance was over the top. Critical and popular opinion is mixed about this. Certainly Grant's performance is manic, but he makes his character physically alive. In any case, it makes a welcome change from later films such as North by Northwest, where Grant's facial expressions are extraordinarily wooden, making me wonder if he had a face lift.

It has been said that Capra had intended to edit the film to tone down Grant's scenes, and make the humour in the movie less broad, but Capra was called away to make his famous propaganda documentary series, Why We Fight. That might be the case, but Capra was always inclined towards encouraging exaggerated acting performances from his cast, so perhaps the final edit would not have been much different.

Capra conceived of the film as an escapist movie in-between his more serious projects. Unusually for his films in this period, it was made quickly and cheaply, comparatively speaking, which may explain its lack of subtlety. However it still over-ran its intended budget and production time.

The salaries for Grant and Capra were a significant part of the budget. So also was the set for the Brewster house. Unusually for a film based on a play, this was the largest set that Warner Brothers had ever created up to this point. As with the set in Dreyer's silent movie, The Passion of Joan of Arc, the expense was squandered and the set under-used. Several rooms that were created in the set for the Brewster house never even appear in the final film.

Capra did use the set to create an eerie Halloween effect though. He employs low-key lighting in some scenes. The area surrounding the Brewster house includes a graveyard, somewhat undermining the claim of one of the film's few intertitles that this is ""one of Brooklyn's most charming districts"". For the outdoors scenes, the set shows a full moon with wispy clouds blowing over it, an abundance of autumn leaves which are blown about by three wind machines, and a tombstone with the name Archie Leach (Grant's real name) on it.

Arsenic and Old Lace was a curiously-timed movie to release during wartime. While American soldiers were dying in Europe, Africa and Asia, sometimes without the honour of a proper burial and gravestone, here was a comedy where bodies were being buried in a cellar, their fate left unknown to the wider world. In a strange twist, the film was shown to the armed forces a year before its release to the general public. Meanwhile Capra was doing his duty for his country by making wartime propaganda movies.

The original writer Joseph Kesselring was the son of German immigrants, which may explain his unique spin on events. He wrote Arsenic and Old Lace at a time when anti-war stories were fashionable. While the play is not exactly anti-war, it does seem to cast an ironic glance at traditional American values, including, it must be said, many of the people that Capra usually stands for ‚Äì respectable small town citizens, the family, and ordinary decent folk.

One could read Arsenic and Old Lace as a metaphor for America, a country that espouses wholesome values like liberty and freedom, whilst concealing the bodies in the basement. The most patriotic figure here is a madman who thinks he is a former president. The genteel upholders of the old order are happy to murder people for supposedly honourable reasons.

The world of the all-American family is one where the window seat contains a corpse, the cupboard is full of the hats of previous victims, and a tumbler full of poisoned wine keeps reappearing and nearly being drank by various individuals. One scene in the film is positively noir-ish. The well-lit daytime scenes give way to misdeeds being performed in the dark, with murky figures moving bodies in and out of the parlour.

However it is important not to get too solemn and po-faced when looking at a comedy. There is no very deep political message in the film, far less indeed than we find in most of Capra's best films. The focus is on having fun.

While many stage plays fail to make good movies due to the static nature of their limited settings, Capra fully embraces the theatricality of his source material. Acting performances are writ large. Characters make numerous entrances and exits to keep the action fresh. There are enough amusing twists to keep us interested.

The style of screwball comedies is one that may be challenging to newcomers who are unfamiliar with the rhythm and style that defined those films in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The constant fast-talking, overlapping dialogue, the shouting and the frantic physical movement can be just as exhausting to watch as any CGI-laden action movie made in the last couple of decades. I imagine even many fans of the movie will collapse in relief when the credits finally roll after two hours of non-stop motion.

However if you can cope with the breakneck virtuosity of Arsenic and Old Lace, it is packed full of amusing jokes, and it has a splendid cast and director.

Arsenic and Old Lace,"First and foremost, this film is a celebration of Cary Grant at his most silly.  I've never seen him mugging, and generally flinging himself around the set to the degree he does in this film.  His over-acting is so committed, it pushes the performance almost into the realm of comic genius.  

His performance as Mortimer Brewster is the highlight, but the chance to get caught up in a classic screwball comedy is the other reason to travel back to 1944.  The Brewster household is made up of some pretty ""nutty"" people, including an uncle who believes he is Teddy Roosevelt, and Mortimer's two aunts, who are such sweet old ladies...we can forgive them for poisoning several elderly single me.  Yes, that's right, they are serial killers!  The relatively sane Mortimer (Grant's over-the-top hamminess not withstanding) arrives on the scene as a newlywed, and on the same day, his estranged, criminal brother Jonathan also arrives on the scene, having undergone plastic surgery which has resulted in him looking like Boris Karloff.  (And Jonathan trails in his wake the deeply creep Dr. Einstein, played by Peter Lorre, doing his best Peter Lorre impersonation.)  It's a very plot driven film, as the best farces must be, but it all holds together very well.  It only seems confusing because Grant is constantly acting surprised, mystified and flumoxed by all of it.  (A couple of his hairs actually fall out of place!)

ARSENIC & OLD LACE was a famous play before Frank Capra made the film, and even though the movie script opens it up beyond the confines of the house that is the primary setting, it still feels a lot like a play.  It's very talky.  Lots of action takes place ""off stage"" (like the infamous cellar), and even though a film COULD take us to these locations, it remains firmly stagebound.  And that's a good thing.  Seeing into the cellar would add nothing to the story, and would take away our ability to imagine what it looks like down there.

Josephine Hull & Jean Adair played the two aunts on Broadway, and they reprise their roles here.  Their performances are unassailable; they ARE Abby & Martha Brewster.  Delightfully clueless.  Raymond Massey is the nefarious Jonathan.  He's quite effective in balancing the need to be both deeply creepy and frightening with the need to be comedic as well.  If he's too scary, the film stops being funny.  If he's too funny, we wouldn't take him seriously, and all tension in the story would be defused way too soon.  

I would have to also credit Capra with juggling the tone of this film.  On its surface, there is NOTHING funny about this story.  No joke; its the story of serial killers and mass murderers.  But it's a farce and just fully embraces the horror of the story and emerges as the blackest screwball comedy of all time.  It's a classic.  Yes, it feels VERY dated in many ways.  Frantic dialogue delivered at a blistering pace.  Lots of shouting.  A VERY uninteresting ""Female love interest"" (poor Priscilla Lane).  Full of stereotypes.  But there are just too many moments of great physical comedy (Grant does an astonishing full body flip on an armchair), situational humor (the cab driver waiting for his fare) and clever writing to let the dust of the years stop you from enjoying it.  

So why only 4 stars?  Well, I'm also reviewing the Criterion Blu Ray, which is probably your best and most likely bet for seeing this film.  Their restoration work on the film is great; it looks like a pristine copy of the film shining from your TV.  But the extras in this are virtually non-existent.  I look the Criterion to give me heaps of bonus material.  Interviews, analysis, production photos, etc. etc.  There's very little here and I was very deeply disappointed.  You can't tell me there aren't some great stories out there about this film!

So your movie-viewing experience will be exemplary.  But your interest in learning more will go largely unfulfilled.",3.5

Arsenic and Old Lace,"My only complaint is that sometimes Cary Grant isn't on the screen. The man is just ludicrously charming. 

Frank Capra made some incredibly sweet movies, but sometimes he goes so overboard with the faith in humanity, they become sickly sweet; senators overturning decades of corrupt behavior out of guilt, or landlords all of a sudden finding a soul and stop themselves from throwing the old widow out on a snowy wintery night. Arsenic and Old Lace is a refreshingly different story for the beloved director to lend his talents to, a black comedy that technically involves a series of murders and an insance escaped criminal but is relentlessly upbeat; Grant is a screwball comedy master here, with such top-notch timing and insane, cooky energy that you wouldn't expect him to have been one of the most acclaimed leading men of all time. Though the script certainly has all the limitations of a stage adaptation, few scripts that started in the theatre can claim to have this level of unpredictability or free-form humor. It's both consistently funny on the surface level (thanks to some excellent performances from Grant, and both Josephine Hull and Jean Adair as his eccentric aunts), and as a class criticism of old blue blood American families with their oddly twisted ideals; many films of recent years that tackle similar themes (Triangle of Sadness, The Menu, etc.) seem to feel the need to be somber, but Capra adapts a riotous stance to arguably greater effect. Love that you never see a body the entire time, despite about half a dozen opportunities for one to appear. 

I feel so bad for Peter Lorre, Hollywood treated him like a monster because he had a slightly distinct appearance and an unusual accent. He had real skill but it got constantly overlooked because of typecasting. Shame Boris Karloff couldn't reprise his stage role here, but the script gives him plenty of callouts. (4/5)",4.0

Arsenic and Old Lace,"Charming and decently funny if somewhat dated, ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is one of those throwbacks from old Hollywood where they would take a Broadway show and then pretty much shoot the film as if it were on the stage. Grant is good, yet overplays the comedic role of the 'sane' Brewster. The rest of the cast, especially the two aunts (Hull and Adair reprising their Broadway performances) and the two brothers (Massey and Alexander) give great performance with dead-pan comic delivery. The cast is thoroughly rounded out by old familiar stars like Edward Everett Horton and a delightful turn by Peter Lorre. Well worth seeing at least once.",3.5
Arthur,"It would have been 1 star if not for the iconic song. A hit song for a forgettable movie, imagine that. I am plain baffled by the reviews exclaiming how hilarious this film is, or what an amazing love story it contains. The Arthur and Linda have zero chemistry, and to boot they are both unlikable characters with very little redeemable qualities, though I must say that Arthur at least is more likable than Linda. Truly the only likable person in this movie (John Gielgud did a phenomenal job) is Arthur's butler, Hobson, and perhaps the chauffeur. 

There is very little film development or story progression, these two meet, then instantly they're in love and spouting lines that are unrealistic. If they had amazing chemistry, love at first sight type of thing, I could believe it, but everything about these two falls flat. It just seems this movie has dozens of scenes missing, because the scenes we do see seem unnatural and rushed, but no scenes are missing. 

I'm not the overly critical, snobby type. I can appreciate the charm of a simple movie. It has to be pretty bad for me to leave a poor review, and unfortunately this movie was one of those.",2.0

It is clear that the value of filmmaking has decreased when compared to the remake. Gielgud's comment that he will ""notify the media"" is the funniest one ever. The beginning, when he arrives at the stuffy gathering with his hooker date, is the greatest part. The movie might have been cut by roughly ten minutes, like with most movies.",4.0

Arthur,"""Do you have any objection to naming our child Vladimir?  Even a girl?""   This movie is one ""one-liner"" after another adeptly delivered by the late Dudley Moore as the millionaire playboy trying to find love and happiness amidst a serious drinking problem and boredom.   Dudley Moore is at his best an is the quintessential drunk in this one.   Sir John Gielgud was phenomenal as the sarcastic Hobbes, the only person who truly understands Arthur and loves him deeply.    Liza Minelli is likable as the love interest.   This movie was hysterical and funny and unique.   The strength was Moore's vulnerability and charm, even as a basically unlivable character.   The music is classically 80's.   The movie has held up and don't see the sequels or remakes.  This one is the one to see.",3.0
Arthur,"Arthur was a sleeper in its day, with a witty screwball comedy mien that hearkened back to golden age screen comedies.  It offers Hollywood wish fulfillment of poor little rich girl/guy who just needs someone to love him for who he is, not his money.  Kid viewers can relate to his immaturity, toys, and wistful need to make everyone laugh.  

Arthur is one of the. most enabled alcoholics ever, booze seems to be his fuel.  He has an entourage of attractive non gold digging females vying to pamper him.  In a way this is a shallow male fantasy but like Hobson the sarcastic butler, viewers learn to love Arthur anyway for his innate decency and harmlessness.  If only all drinkers were like that.",4.0
Arthur,"I will admit that I originally watched this simply for the theme song. The rest of the people is pretty good with good costumes and sets. I enjoyed most of the characters, however it is hard to truly enjoy the film when the main protagonist is drunk throughout the whole film and bugs you.",3.5
Arthur,"I missed the beginning of the movie, but what I saw of it was quite enough. The supporting cast, especially Shakespearean actor John Gielgud as Arthur's sarcastic butler, did a good job, but the main characters unfortunately brought the movie down.

Arthur, the star, is a rich happy drunk with no ambition, and his family arranges him to marry a rich woman whom he does not love, but he must go through with it or lose his chance of inheriting the family fortune. Along the way he meets a waitress/struggling actress whom he does fall in love with. What to do? The movie's major problem is that we're supposed to find a man with a drinking problem humorous. Trouble is, drunkards are not happy people-see ""Leaving Las Vegas"" to show how having a drinking problem is really like. Not fun at all. Arthur's butler shows real concern for him, and Arthur redeems himself by his showing concern for him as he dies-but the redemption is temporary. In the end he shows up drunk at his wedding and publicly humiliates his bride. Ha, ha. Of course he will get his fortune anyway in the end.

The other problem is Liza Minelli as the girlfriend. Her career only existed because her father, director Vincent Minelli, pushed her into her acting career, as she looks ugly and is a weak actress. Seeing her is as appealing as eating an average worm sandwich. (Though admittedly the movie would have been a turkey no matter who played the girlfriend.)",0.5
Arthur,"Dudley Moore is a wealthy New York City playboy Arthur Bach He's perpetually drunk and completely rudderless, laughing every second he gets

His father wants him to be set for life but of course they resent each other; if Arthur refuses to marry Susan he will be completely cut off from all funds 
However, when he meets Liza Minelli's Linda Marolla who's a waitress from Queens, he falls head over heels in love, but if he backs out of his engagement with Susan, he may lose his fortune
Dudley Moore carries the movie gracefully with his energetic performance despite him and Eliza Minnelli only sharing a few scenes together

He's never taken care of anybody since it's always been by himself
It's a bit messy when it comes to the finale but all the more fitting

AVOID THE SEQUEL AT ALL COSTS!",3.0
Arthur,"Arthur is probably one of the finest romantic comedies I have seen in a very long time, an especially charming one whose cast and crew really make it different than any other of its kind and elevate its cliched plot. Arthur Bach (a spectacular Dudley Moore) is constantly drunk millionaire playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, takes the weekends off and is his own boss"". He leads an affluent life with his sharp witted and sarcastic friend, father figure and butler Hobson (John Gielgud, in his very best role, worthy of the Oscar he received, he stole the show). He is to marry the snub, mundane daughter of a businessman, and if he doesn't, he'll lose an inheritance of over half a billion dollars. It is when he meets a poor, aspiring actress from Queens (Liza Minnelli, truly wonderful and explosive) that he realizes that true love is priceless and that he must grow up to face the consequences of his dreams and hopes. The only film by Steve Gordon, the film boasts a top tier cast, including the hilarious supporting roles, one of the finest soundtracks I have heard in a movie (by veteran Burt Bacharach, who shared an Oscar for Best Song with three other people, that song is still stuck in my head) and incredible scenery and art direction (the wonderful, charming New York and the Bach Mansion...). The make up and costumes are wonderful as well. The true star of the movie is the carefully written screenplay and direction. Gordon has the ability to balance intelligent humor, some serious themes, fascinating dialogue that keeps you interested and beautiful shots in a hilarious movie about growing up, the power of love and money, loss and death and the simple things in life, tied together with the signature Arthur's laugh and jokes. I love this movie just for the dialogue, the jokes (much like Being There, the film is not so much of a comedy, though the humor is present and smart) and the aesthetic that elevate the usually boring premise into somehing truly unique. My only problems are the fact that the ""drunk"" joke is taken just a tad too far, and the fact that the cinematography and editing make the film feel like a made for television film or a theatrical play for the screen, consequently feeling that some scened drag a litle bit. Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough for essentially everything. ""Maybe I should come in and wash your d*ck for you, you little sh*t.""",4.5
Arthur,"Supposedly about how an irresponsible yet uber-rich man-boy (Dudley Moore) finds real love, this is really about said multimillionaire's father-son relationship with his caring manservant (John Gielgud, who steals the film effortlessly). Oh, there is a love story supplied, but there is little to it, chemistry-wise or story-wise. Our hero is barely-able-to-walk drunk when he decides to ""grow up"" and run off with the miscast Liza Minnelli, and one feels as if he will run off yet again once he returns to his senses, away from her. This was a popular film in it's time, but since then has lost its appeal, propped up by the singular gag of a stream of Borscht Belt style patter incongruously delivered by a short English drunk.",3.0
Arthur,"Great feel to this picture and it's all down to a stand out performance from the title character played by Dudley Moore. Lots of charm, wit and fun with a dash of warm heartedness.

Arthur,"The first and only film to be both written and directed by Steve Gordon, who tragically passed away at the age of 44 a year after the release of this movie, ""Arthur"" is one of the very few comedies I've seen that I can say I thoroughly enjoyed, yet sparsely laughed during. Granted, I did smile or at least make a mental note of when I thought the movie was being relatively clever in its comedic stylings. Still, though, I'm shocked at how hand-in-hand the comedy remains with the other elements of the movie, namely the character work and overall spirit of the film. The relationship between Dudley Moore's titular protagonist and Sir John Gielgud's Academy Award winning turn as the wise-cracking butler, ""Hobson,"" was more than just hilarious. You get honest-to-God emotion from the more serious aspects of their bond. And, I have to say, for being a comedy of the more romantic persuasion, it's been a minute since I've seen one where I honestly enjoyed seeing the two leads perform together in the same scene. Sweet and impressive.",3.5
Arthur,"The film dangerously teeters into trifle territory with an obsession of booze humour, a mentality of money is everything, and a predictable odd meets reasonable love story coupled with a disappointing Liza Minelli performance.‚Ä®
Thankfully, ""Arthur"" manages to reach safe ground by its end as it recognizes the dark side of rich class, shows empathy for its titular character (a difficult performance to make likeable by Dudley Moore), and has touches of wit to string along with (the best lines are delivered by John Gielgud).‚Ä®
These qualities are only enough to provide an average film though.",3.0
Arthur,"As the remake proved, the material here would make for an otherwise middling romcom, if not for its primary pair of irreproachable performances, which perfectly epitomize the quintessence of the snooty butler and drunk playboy archetypes, bringing depth and nuance to what, in lesser hands, would seem as mere caricatures.",3.5

The music is very good also with a unique mixture of funk, 60's rock, and modern soundtrack. The editing and pacing are very well done also as this moves at lighting speed. The most important element here are the jokes and they work really well. Most get at least a smile or a cool ""Aha!"" moment especially if your a 007 fan. It's as much a spoof as it is a love letter to Spy Films and 007. The only real problems here are some of the jokes particularly some of the toilet humor and sex jokes go on a bit too long particularly in the first half and kind of fall flat. Also if your not a 007 fan you'll enjoy this because it has so much energy and charm to it but a lot of jokes will have you scratch your head if your not familiar with the what they are spoofing.

The Bank Dick,"If you've never ventured into the world of W.C. Fields, The Bank Dick is probably your best bet as a starting point.  Fields plays Egbert Souse, a hard drinking hater of children who inadvertently becomes a local hero when he accidently foils a bank robbery.  While the plot is wafer-thin, it gives Fields an opportunity to flex his considerable comedic muscles, spewing out non-sequiturs from start to finish.  Some of the humor misses the mark, but there are enough one-liners (""I'm very fond of children. Girl children, around eighteen and twenty!!"") and more than enough sight gags (Fields disarming a child with a toy gun) to keep things interesting.",3.5

The Bank Dick,"W.C. Fields was a master at defining his persona and sticking to it, but that persona doesn't reach the same level of universality as Fields' silent era contemporaries; his dimwitted, 'henpecked' caricature is performed very ably but gets old fast, such that his near-monotone starts to sound like white noise as the film goes on. The Bank Dick reaches its greatest heights when it ignores the dialogue-heavy buffoonery of its main character and instead starts to dive into more classic physical comedy towards the finale, particularly the car chase and the many gags involved. The slow delivery by Fields gives the whole film a sluggish tone for long stretches, zapping it of the energy that other early sound comedians like the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy had. Credit where it's due, though; The Bank Dick is much better realized than Fields' earlier classic It's a Gift, actually putting together something of a cohesive story rather than relying on loosely stitched-together scenes.

There's family comedy and some pretty funny bits with Fields trying to prevent a bank examiner from looking at the bank's books. Fields wrote the screenplay too, using the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves, which is a play on the phrase ""My hat, my cane, Jeeves"" which fields is actually given by his butler at the end of the film.

The mood can be a bit all over the place as it moves from quick burns of each character to the slapstick comedy that Anthony Anderson delivers. Yet, Tim Story is able to combine each element of the story in an enjoyable bundle.

Barbershop

Story is not much of a narrator, but definitely can tell a funny joke without any jokes. The film feels like some episode of a sitcom. Parallel-y the tales are enfolded with a revelation of foolishness carved out smartly and calculatively, the director, Tim Story, had to only juggle that very aspect and all was and is game. It is also incredibly and instantly likable, more than even Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, and probably because it is light on feet, in contrast to Lee's heavy sensitive issue spewed like vengeance, fair and square. Never have I seen a film so smooth and confident in its tiny tales of woe it tells by mocking it and accepting the consequences of it.

Picturing the lifestyle of barbers in a barbershop, in one day, there is a lot to enjoy, learn and laugh from. And as Cedric The Entertainer once says, ""If we can't talk straight in a barbershop, then where can we talk straight"" and so it does feel that honest. The warmth between the characters comes in easy just as the bitterness does. They are ready to go at each other in a snap and also ready to make up in a snap with Marvin Gaye playing in the background.

Ice Cube as a mislead young man and easily seduced and troubled family guy trying to reach for more, spirals out a chaotic event so big that even a gang that cannot stand each other, stands once and for all, together. To me, Cedric would be the game changer in here, his elderly persona where he treats others like students, his students by heckling and inspiring them in each steps, is a proper reliable statement. Barbershop is a shop for sure, you come in and get what you want, you'd be surprised with the quality of the product and why not, it definitely is a new bold fashion look.",3.0

Barbershop,"As with any film featuring Ice Cube, Barbershop caught my attention due to a N.W.A. Obsession.

Barbershop is much like Ice Cube's breakthrough comedy vehicle Friday (1995). Both films depict the everyday experiences of the African-American community in as their experiences with social structures and relationships provide comedic banter. Barbershop's narrative is constructed out of a series of characters who each have their own story which is present for the sake of loose characterization, but not so much for any real narrative development. The story in Barbershop is a really simplistic one, but it also means that it's an easygoing one. 
Viewers don't have to involve themselves too deeply within the story to enjoy the experience as it is mainly a straightforward comedic venture. The themes in the story are legitimate as the entire film centres around the concept of community; bringing people together to assist each other as friends or simple acquaintances. The underlying message in the film is not preachy or reliant on sentimentality, rather it is one which simply gives a genuine feeling of positivity to the film. It is a really basic theme and a also a rather familiar one, but Barbershop works around this by letting it flow naturally alongside the comedy in the film. Barbershop is a film sourcing its humour from the inherent nature of each character's individuality and through the way they react to various situations over the course of a singular day. 
What I really like about Barbershop is the fact that it doesn't rely on simple racial stereotypes to bolster its comedy. The characters are not defined by their race, they are defined by their humanity and the humour comes from the way they interact with each other at a swift and believable rate. There is a side plot surrounding the physical gag of two characters constantly trying to break open a stolen ATM, but the main comic focus in the film simply plays into the dialogue from the characters. Barbershop's refusal to submit to simplistic stereotypes is one of its finest qualities, even when it manages to border on them without crossing the line. An example of this include the fact that the term ""Damn"" is used sporadically over the course of the film without ever getting excessive, effectively providing some of the funniest moments in the film due to a lack of overexposure. 
Barbershop also knows the right time to tone down its comedic elements. The story doesn't offer any major development but does have some good moments of drama that still maintain the lighthearted charm of the film. For example, the moment where Terri Jones breaks up with her cheating boyfriend without resorting to any kind of aggressive racial stereotype provides a really compelling moment of realistic drama. She tells him in the most respectful manner she can, getting frustrated only slightly as he refuses to accept the reality of the situation. Barbershop is a comedy which knows when to restrain itself while functioning on a dramatic level, even taking some occasional moments to discuss some really intelligent concepts about racial identity without being a tedious political statement.
Barbershop succeeds on a small budget as it functions within a singular location which is ripe with appealing scenery. With its simplistic narrative and reliance on dialogue, the performances of the cast are a key factor in bringing it to prominence. And Tim Story lets their natural charms flourish.
Ice Cube is a fine lead for Barbershop. Ice Cube has proven his talents for comedy multiple times, and Barbershop provides a key opportunity for him to remind us all of that. The film provides him a pivotal opportunity for him to show audiences that he is far more than a one-dimensional stereotype. Fans of his work on Friday can enjoy the fact that he maintains an edgy nature which he occasionally injects into the humour, but everyone can rejoice mainly at the fact that his performance is one of subtlety. Most of what he has to say comes from his facial expressions as he remains silent, contemplating what everyone around him means to his character. Calvin Palmer Jr. comes off as a really genuine character, and Ice Cube manages to project a humanized sense of drama in the role with a knack for comic timing. Ice Cube portrays a character of more sophistication than viewers have seen him play before, and it comes across so naturally that it pays a lot of credibility to the man. Ice Cube prove his worth as an actor of simple drama and subtlety in Barbershop while keeping audiences laughing at the right moments.
However, the real star of Barbershop is Cedric the Entertainer. Though he is never officially over the top, Eddie is able to push the limits on a somewhat stereotypical character without ever being a repetitive gimmick. Eddie is a passionately Black character who uses elements of a racial stereotype without ever becoming one. Cedric the Entertainer uses his natural energy to drive a swift and commanding line delivery with added minor physical movements to reinforce the passion for what his character has to say. Yet when the dialogue becomes focused on discussing something of legitimate narrative value, the actor pulls himself back and tones it all down. Cedric the Entertainer knows when to kick it into full gear and when to restrain himself, and the way he stands on both ends of the spectrum with such inherent charisma is a real testament to the claim made his stage name. Cedric the Entertainer is the funniest thing about Barbershop, and his timing is consistently perfect.
The banter between Eve, Sean Patrick Thomas, Leonard Earl Howze and Troy Garity provides a consistently funny atmosphere for Barbershop with every actor bringing something of their own that stands out. Anthony Anderson's comic energy keeps the subplot of the film entertaining, and as a fan of his work with John Carpenter I am really happy to see Keith David active in mainstream cinema again.

Barbershop has a simplistic narrative which relies on familiar themes and little story development, but its realistic characters and delightful cast help to support it as a well-meaning and funny experience which is easy to sit back and embrace.",3.5

Being There,"Being There, a deeply strange and awkward film starring Peter Sellers, tiptoes meekly around deep ideas and then asks irrelevant questions. The film is a calm, gentle, and serene satire, of... society? Television? Being a white man? Being simple? Who can say. The film comments on all these topics, but it doesn't seem to have any strong convictions about anything, other than that if you're a polite, imbecilic white man surrounded by money, you're actually Jesus Christ (and I don't think the film even believes in THAT message very much either).
Witness in disappointment how the movie spends its entire runtime trying to convince the viewer of its main characters mystique, only to end on a blooper reel, unspooling an entire films worth of whimsey in three minutes.
That being said, the film is beautiful to look at and there's some great music and performances, which saves Being There"" from being boring or shoddy, but not from feeling meaningless.",3.5
Being There,"I can only take this movie for what it is, a movie. There really is no plot, no good or bad people, no secret messages. But this movie is all Peter Sellers, and he does a remarkable performance. After venturing from his home, it is unlikely he would wind up in an extremely wealthy family tycoon mansion. More likely he would have remained homeless and destitute. Sellars and Shirley MacLaine, Eve, had good chemistry together in this movie. Someone, especially the doctor, would have figured him out. The best part of the movie is when Sellars walks on water at the end. It gives his character, Chauncy, a divine dignity. It was good to see how the wealthy live in luxury. The photography of the movie was good. Cheers.",3.0
Being There,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out.  Peter Sellers was a big star in comedies and this was his first non-comedic role.

It's implied and implied isn't the word , he flatly states that he's never left the house, it's his prisoner for being born dumb, Chance seems like an empty vessel, without even the capacity for love when he goes to see The ""Old Man"" dead in his bed.  But when Ben dies he cries, it shows that he understands death and lose, because Ben treated like an equal and a friend, and a father figure, not a someone that should be locked away and hidden. Ben was the father he never had! I feel like he actually felt love for the first time in his life, and with that anything was possible!",5.0
Being There,unusual and poetic. also slow. Hal Ashby's point of view is always sharp.,2.5
Being There,"This is a very quirky and quite subtle film. Its a comedy of sorts - definitely a very dry comedy, not a visual, big belly laugh type of a comedy but I enjoyed it for being something a little different. Sellers does well portraying a slightly confused  and unsure person, someone is just...well, being there, although he is also seemingly quite knowledgable, someone who it appears knows more than perhaps he realises himself. The plot is, I think its fair to say, somewhat hard to believe but I found it amusing in terms of knowing more, as a viewer, of Chance's situation as depicted at the start of the film, so seeing people misinterpret him was certainly amusing. There is a definite element of social awkwardness present, often in relation to the upper social classes, which I found amusing. I liked this film and I'd recommend it to others, as something a little different. It has a surreal feel about it. I'd also say its a relatively memorable film as well.",4.0

Being There,"I remember seeing the glowing reviews when I was younger, and when the movie came out on videotape I was anxious to see it, and saw it with my mother and aunt. We were so glad we didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.

Yes, the premise is that Chance is supposed to be an idiot spouting simple phrases, and the idea is that people mistake it for profundity, or at least make these statements profound with their own wishful thinking. Yes, people can be fooled initially. BUT...

All Chance does is keep spouting simple phrases and otherwise staring out vacuously. And nobody gets suspicious? Worse yet, Chance is shown to have no feelings. He is completely indifferent to the death of the man he lived under for decades. We could laugh at the idea of idiocy being taken for profundity (happens all the time in real life), but there's nothing funny about someone without feelings.

As another poster remarked, Peter Sellers was evidently a worse psychological basket case than his biographies said.

I decided to add a few things, in light of the surprising number of glowing reviews this movie has had. Of course there are always people who think a particular movie, no matter how bad it really is, is something wonderful and meaningful. But in this movie, I find that those who praise this movie fail to understand that they are the ones being mocked by the storyline.

The premise is that people who are rich and powerful are all taken in by the idea that Chance is a genius rather than the brain-dead person he really is. I was waiting to see how everyone was going to react when they realized who Chance really was, but that never happens. People who have gotten where they were through guile and ambition are so gullible as all that? Nobody gets suspicious over a man with no apparent background, not even any home or family? I would have found it infinitely more believable if the rich and powerful actually knew Chance was just a simpleton, and manipulated him as a front man, but that is not what happens in this story.

As for the claim that Chance was only misinterpreted as especially brilliant because he was white, and wouldn't be if he were black, that idea was made obsolete with the election of President Obama. He was hyped as a messiah who would work miracles, and as it turns out he is at best just another politician.",0.5
Being There,extremely weird ending,3.0
Being There,"Before Forrest Gump used a similar premise for a more nostalgic and less subtle take on the same general character (a well-intentioned but slow protagonist that indirectly lampoons society around him through a serious of tremendously benevolent misunderstandings), Chauncey Gardiner made the world laugh and suffer from crippling secondary embarassment simultaneously. While very much a comedy of manners, Being There becomes a full-on satire of modern culture, media, pseudointellectualism, and personality, largely by letting Gardiner's very literal remarks linger in the air before being carefully misconstrued as worldly wisdom, with each slip-up seeming to spell his inevitable downfall but ultimately only reinforcing the perception of guarded knowledge. The film remains a poignant reflection on the myth of the meritocracy in modern society, taking even an intermittent stance on race that still seems biting. 

Sellers' performance in Being There is absolutely towering, demonstrating that even decades after he had experienced the height of his popularity there was a reason for his initial rise. Most notably, the characterization of Gardiner makes use of Sellers' particular penchant for physical comedy but absolutely doesn't overtly rely on it - it's a demonstration of the accomplished comedian's true acting chops that sells the character. I like Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer as much as the next guy, but if you're considering the actual performances, it's hard to say that a comparison between him and Sellers in Being There doesn't lean heavily towards the latter; everything in this character is designed from the ground up with a purpose. (4/5)",4.0
Being There,"Brilliant satire from the master Hal Ashby!

Director Hal Ashby's comedy Being There (1979) is a blast to watch and it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes along to its resplendent conclusion. I was smiling, laughing, and thinking the entire time as Ashby splices together 70's pop culture and politics with a sly absurdism over how tumultuous these times were for America. Johnny Mandel's score even captures the strangeness of this era with his opening funk remix of Also Sprach Zarathustra.

I appreciated the lush sets with such meticulous lavishness from the production designer Michael D. Haller. May Routh's costumes are gorgeous on the lovely Shirley MacLaine, who is hilarious as the kind hearted and super horny Eve Rand. MacLaine is a pleasure to watch her flirt with Peter Sellers and find a poignant heartfelt realness towards her love. It's also cool to see director Hal Ashby even cameo in the movie later on as the man by the cabinet at the newspaper The Washington Post.

Caleb Deschanel's cinematography captures all these cute wide shots and a mesmerizing final shot of Peter Sellers walking on water with all his blissful ignorance, light as air. Being There is gorgeously shot. Don Zimmerman's editing is sharp and gently allows Being There to walk steadily to its pleasant absurdities for a quickly paced 130 minutes. The way Zimmerman cuts together 70's television into these outrageous montages is simply sublime as you get to see all the imagery and entertainment that Chance the gardener sees.

Writers Jerzy Kosinski and Robert C. Jones finds the laughter out of obtuse, ignorant, rich conservatives who unknowingly take in a now homeless gardener played by Peter Sellers. Being There is a clever satire of 1970's conservative policies, government lobbying, presidential influence from special interests, racial dynamics, television as education, economics disparity, and American ego. 

Hal Ashby shows how people only hear what they want to hear from Peter Sellers' simple minded gardener Chance because of their own narcissism and ego. He has no idea about what anyone is talking about in Being There, yet his words apply to everything in a hilarious display of good humor from Sellers and Ashby. Their words bring Ashby's striking satire to a warm and funny life of its own. Being There is certainly one of Hal Ashby's greatest films, if not his best picture.

Peter Sellers beautifully portrays a man named Chance who stumbles through life with a dependence on the kindness of strangers as Blanche Dubois said, because he's mentally a still a child. Sellers delivers a heartfelt and nuanced performance that really captures the chaos of the 1970's both economically and politically with a more reserved acting than you're probably used to seeing from the famous comedian. He's hilarious as the straight man as everyone else is just crazy to talk to Chance, who they never really understand as Being There is a comedy of errors because Chance is so vague, everyone he speaks to hears whatever they want out of his meaningless dialogue.

Jack Warden's foolish Republican President Bobby is a clear stand in for the Gerald Fords and Richard Nixons of America with his need for conservative advice, idiotic manner, and strange paranoia. I enjoyed Melvyn Douglas' totally sincere performance as the conservative lobbyist and special interests millionaire investor Ben Rand. He feels as much Kissinger as a Dick Cheney type in hindsight. 

Richard Dysart is funny as Dr. Robert Allenby, who is the only man to understand who Chance really is in reality. You totally see how conspiracies, espionage, and paranoia grow as every intelligence agency and country wants to know who Chance is, but it takes the sole observant man to get Peter Sellers' silly normal man. Ruth Attaway's maid Louise sums up how only a white man could get by being illiterate and idiotic and still thrive in America.

In short, Being There sees Peter Sellers saying little, while Hal Ashby's film speaks volume on America's broken economic inequality and corrupt political system.",5.0
Being There,"Being There is an amusing anecdote that goes on a little too long. Yes, we understand that people mistake Chance's simple-mindedness for genius, but do we really need to show that for over two hours?

There is nothing remarkable about this lazy performance and film.

Being There,"Director Hal Ashby had an unparalleled run of wildly successful films during the 70s, culminating with what was arguably his masterpiece, Being There.  With a screenplay by Jerzy Kosinski based on his own novel, the film stars Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardener (or Chauncey Gardiner), an intellectually challenged man who relates to the world by using what he has learned from watching television and working in the garden.  He is eventually adopted as an unofficial advisor to Washington's political elite, including the President, who see him as an intellectual with astute, albeit cryptic, views on the world.  Sellers gives a brilliant performance, the satire is biting, and Ashby cements his standing as one of America's great (but underappreciated) directors.",4.5

Being There,"Being There is a rare movie. It is a gem that gets a lot of attention upon its release, then gets forgotten for many years, and then hollowed out of its temorary grave. I am so glad I came across this film on DVD after so many years. This movie is remembered as Peter Sellers' swan song, where he gave the performance of a lifetime. The plot is aptly a simple one; after the death of his employer, naive Chance has to leave the house where he lived since he was young. With limited knowledge of the outside world, only knowing what he has seen on TV and gardening, he is released into the cruel and relentless world. Fortunately for him, he gets involved in an accident with sickly businessman Ben Rant (an Oscar winning performance by veteran Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley McLaine) and they decide to let him live in their mansion. The Rants mistakenly think Chance is an influential politician (confusing his name with Chauncey Gardiner), since they construe his utterances and gardening tips as a profound, sophisticated critique of politics, economy, existentialism and the overall state of human existence. He climbs up the stairs of success to the point where he is bound to be chosen as an official presidential candidate. Then suddenly, he vanishes in a Christlike manner. Our simple minded Chance however, cannot seem to understand his position and does not really want to. All he needs is a caring home, a television and a garden to take care of. The novel of the same name by Jerzy Kosinski was a labor of love for Sellers, who adored the central character. After the novel's release, he sent the author a telegram saying ""AVAILABLE IN MY GARDEN OR OUTSIDE OF IT"". That explains the film's success. Peter Sellers, the chameleon actor, absolutely nailed the role of Chance, giving a superb performance worthy of an Oscar (unfortunately he lost to an equally good Dustin Hoffmann). Along with Sellers' unique and somehow sad performance, the film is driven by Hal Ashby, an exquisite director who is responsible for many thought provoking and bizarre films like Harold and Maude. Instead of making the film a clumsy story based on human guillibility and stupidity, he benefits from an incredible screenplay and gives the film a slow, winter like, melancholic pace. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well,  the score (Based on Erik Satie's Gnossiennes 4 and 6) is haunting and memorable to say the least and the cinematography is out of this world. All of these factors work together and create a very bitter and sharp comedy drama, whose themes are so profound and well presented that i highly recommend watching this one and exploring those yourself. I like to watch...",5.0

Best in Show,"Cute dogs and hilarious jokes.

Director Christopher Guest's mockumentary comedy Best In Show (2000) is a blast. Even if a character's jokes don't land, you get to watch all these adorable show dogs just looking around and vibing. It's a fast paced and funny comedy with the added benefit of a bunch of dogs for a cute atmosphere. Guest takes what he learned directing Waiting for Guffman and polished it off for Best In Show's vibrant colors, sharp humor, and grounded characters for a better overall film. Guest does not dwell on any certain character for too long and it helps keeps the dogs walking and the owners feeling manic for Best In Show's chaotic energy.

I love that the televised National Dog Show was not even a thing until after Best In Show. It's interesting how this movie has stayed in the pop culture zeitgeist. Cinematographer Roberto Schaefer shoots scenes like the cast is getting interviewed with handheld looking movements and camera pans as dogs parade in the show. Guest really just made his own dog show curtains and all. There's real Canadian Dog Show champions for the pets and actual dog trainers used to help make the movie. It's actually impressive how realistic they got it. 

Writers Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy come up with fun ways to satirize the yuppies and average joes who worship and spoil their dogs to the point of abuse just to win a Blue Ribbon at the National Dog Show. The dialogue is mostly improvised with 60 hours of talking cut down to the funniest scenes and best takes by editor Robert Leighton's slick cutting style. Best In Show is very similar to other mockumentary comedies like This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, or Drop Dead Gorgeous. Casting director Stuart Aikins hired a hilarious ensemble for Best In Show.

Eugene Levy's awkward and emasculated Gerry Fleck is an exemplary depiction of cringe comedy. Catherine O'Hara flirting with all of her ex's is a riot, especially as it causes Levy anguish. Their Norwich terrier is adorable and fluffy. Larry Miller's cameo as Max Berman is crazy with his overt seducing of O'Hara. 

John Michael Higgins' flamboyantly gay dog walker Scott Donlan is a scream. His chemistry and breezy humor with Michael McKean's delightful Stefan Vanderhoof is a pleasure to watch. They may be the best pair to watch overall with two cute Shih Tzu dogs.

Parker Posey is amazing as the panicked yuppie Meg Swan. Posey effortlessly portrays a sexually satisfied dog sycophant, who is paranoid about her dog not loving her or being able to perform. Her screaming at Hiro Kanagawa's Pet Shop Owner for a bumble bee dog toy is the funniest bit in Best In Show! Posey continues to make me laugh uproariously as she really is one of the all time funniest actresses. Parker Posey is sublime as the gorgeous and hysterically deranged Meg Swan. Posey yelling at Carmen Aguirre's poor Taft Hotel Maid is so sad, infuriating, and funny all at once.

Michael Hitchcock is excellent and insane as the raving yuppie freak Hamilton Swan. His frenzied frothing at the mouth yelling at the dog to focus is simultaneously scary and hilarious. Hitchcock matches Posey's unhinged mania just like their rabid dog.

Jennifer Coolidge's constantly eating, telepathic lesbian Sherri Ann Cabot is a real scream in her own right. Coolidge has always been funny ever since I saw her in Legally Blonde. She's sexy and silly. Coolidge has great chemistry with Jane Lynch's confident lesbian Christy Cummings. I liked their cuddly well behaved poodle.

Christopher Guest is really great as the understated redneck hunter Harlan Pepper. He delivers a strong character actor performance alongside his lovable bloodhound. Fred Willard proves he's a master of improv with the wildest and most hilariously erratic lines as National Dog Show host Buck Laughlin. Ed Begley Jr.'s accommodating hotel concierge Mark Schafer is great like Bob Balaban's stoic showrunner Theodore W. Millbank III. Lewis Arquette cameos as a funny Fern City Show Spectator.

Composer Jeffery C.J. Vanston's pleasant music helps Best In Show's absurdist vibes. Monique Prudhomme, Durinda Wood, and Diana Patterson provide absolutely insane outfits for the whole cast. Everyone gets a colorful and strange costume that brings out the silliness of their character. Hairstyling from Anji Bemben and Kandace Loewen is outrageous with a plethora of looks for each person, especially the ladies. Coolidge gets the best hair for sure, but I kept laughing when Parker Posey appears.

In short, Best In Show is a timeless comedy cult classic. It's 90 minutes of cute dogs and their mentally ill owners. What's not to like?",5.0
Best in Show,Hands down one of the most unique movies out there. It gets better with each viewing especially with the chemistry of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy. All of the actors have over the top characters that are honest and believable. This movie is not talked about enough and I hope every Schitt's Creek fan watches it.,5.0
Best in Show,parker posey's acting is the funniest part of this movie by far.  it's hard to rate between her and fred willard but i chose her. the busy bee scenes make me laugh uncontrollably,4.5
Best in Show,"It's a weird genre, those offbeat mockumentary comedies especially when actors improving are involved. You can feel the awkwardness when sometimes the characters have to react to something or go on with their dialogue. I don't say the actors are bad they are actually great. I don't think you could have a better cast for this challenge, especially the couple Hitchcock and Posey who may have the most clever jokes here.  That said, it's just impossible to have a perfect comedic timing when you can't anticipate where a scene or a dialogue goes.

The movie is not very exciting, sometimes boring, but I still recommend it because when the jokes works they are pretty funny, thanks again to the perfect cast. Also the dogs are cute.",3.0
Best in Show,"Am I missing something here?  I don't get the high scores from Ebert, Metacritic, and Netflix as well as Rotten Tomatoes.  A real send up of the people who pamper their dogs for these shows, kinda like parents who doll up their young daughters for beauty pagents.",3.0
Best in Show,"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. A cast of very funny people putting together a very funny movie about an original subject. I'm also laughing at these reviews from people that just ""did not get it."" The humor is often subtle, and possibly over the heads of people that need a laugh track on the TV sitcom to know what's funny. 
The show dog world is quite unique and quirky, just like this movie. Christopher Guest is a genius for taking a situation ripe for humor right out from under our noses, and then hitting it out of the ballpark.",5.0

As a plot, it's also quite a brainless revenge tale, but thanks to several challenges for our lead, it's pretty fun and engaging. The film's soundtrack is also a blast. Beverly Hills Cop is a great time and comes highly recommended!",4.5
Beverly Hills Cop,"Eddie Murphy combines comedy with gritty cop drama so well it should be a crime 
The story feels dark and edgy and has a nasty sprit to it 
How some criminals live above the law but not out of a vengeful man's reach 
Axel foley is a legendary character and his personality becomes dangerously infectious 
The action shoot outs are thrilling 
And the casting gives us one of the greatest buddy cop movies of all time as taget and billy become just as likeable as axel 
The soundtrack is iconic and and gives the film another bouncy element to it that you can't help get dragged away with 
You just want more and more from this cheeky cop who plays by his own bent rules and will get the bad guy if it's personal 
In short it's a rollercoaster action comedy that many will strive to duplicate but fall short without its dream cast",5.0

Beverly Hills Cop,"Minha opini√£o: Poder assistir a Eddie Murphy da d√©cada de 80 √© surreal. Um Tira da Pesada, Um pr√≠ncipe em NY, 48 horas, Trocando as Bolas,.... e depois mais sucessos na dpecada de 90, 2000 e at√© o ultimo que gostei muito e acho que merecia um #Oscar por Meu nome √© Dolemite, que representa√ß√£o. Vamos ao √≠nicio de sua carreira onde vai se consagrando em #Hoolywood Este filme se passa em Bervely Hills e ele vem de Detroit, de um DP bem caid√£o e um chefe linha dura. Mas Eddie tem um amigo que √© assassinado em sua frente e ele vai em busa de quem fez isso. Vai atr√°s de sua amiga Jenny que arranjou o emprego para seu amigo e logo ele j√° desconfia do chefe dela Jeffrey. Assim ele √© capturado pela policia local e la conhece a dupla de detetives William e Sargent que far√£o a dupla com ele. Por√©m eles s√£o todos certinhos enquanto Eddie vem da malandragem de Detroit. Ser√° que dar√° certo? √â claro que sim. Um filme que a velocidade dos filmes da d√©cada de 80 eram mais lentos. E assim eles v√£o descobrindo mais e mais at√© que chega na parte final onde o tiro corre para todo canto. E o bem vence o mal. Vemos que mesmo tendo passado mais de 40 anos, n√£o vemos uma grande diferen√ßa em Eddie. Dizem que neste ano querem lan√ßar Um Tira da Pesada 4. Vamos esperar.
Roteiro e enredo simples, mas com a m√°gia de Eddie o filme se transforma.
Vale apena assistir? Com certeza, um cl√°ssico.

Big,"Tom Hanks' ""BIG"" is charming and heartfelt.",5.0
Big,Been re-watching some old films with my sons. This is a heart-warming classic which the whole family enjoyed.,5.0
Big,Literally one of the sweetest and extremely heartwarming film ever made by Penny Marshall! Loved every ounce of it! What it truly means to be a child and grow up!,5.0
Big,"""Big"" is an enchanting and heartwarming cinematic masterpiece that captures the essence of childhood wonder and the timeless spirit of imagination. Tom Hanks delivers a remarkable performance as Josh Baskin, a young boy who magically transforms into an adult overnight, granting him a glimpse into the grown-up world.

Director Penny Marshall expertly crafts a delightful narrative filled with humor, warmth, and poignant life lessons. The film effortlessly blends the hilarity of a child trying to navigate the responsibilities of adulthood with heartfelt moments that touch the soul. It explores the universal desire to grow up quickly while cherishing the joys of innocence.

The screenplay boasts clever dialogues, and the chemistry between Hanks and co-star Elizabeth Perkins is simply magical. The supporting cast, including John Heard and Robert Loggia, adds depth and charm to the story.

""Big"" stands the test of time due to its endearing themes and the messages it imparts. It encourages viewers to cherish their inner child and embrace the simplicity and joy in life. The iconic scene of Josh dancing on the giant piano remains an enduring symbol of innocent joy that resonates with audiences of all ages.

In conclusion, ""Big"" is an uplifting, feel-good classic that continues to captivate generations, reminding us to appreciate life's little wonders and never lose touch with our childlike dreams.",5.0

Big,"Absolutely one of Tom Hanks' finest roles I remember watching this a few years back and loved it It's one of the earliest age-reversal movies following the original 'Freaky Friday' and before '13 Going on 30' and '17 Again' directed by Penny Marshall 12 year-old boy Josh feels out of place Being a kid he feels like he doesn't have the luxury of enjoying as many things the way grown ups do So at a carnival he makes a wish from a mechanical magician named Zoltar to be all grown-up Shockingly it comes true and he wakes up in a fully grown adult body played by Hanks Josh is shocked, scared, and confused he's aged several years over night His own mother doesn't recognize him so he ends up leaving home forced to stay elsewhere He's never been on his own so he only has his current kid friend, Billy to help him get a place, a job, and act like an adult Josh later ends up working at a toy factory (still having that childlike spirit he plays with various toy products) catching wind of the executives having him test them out and seeing how they sell to consumers He makes Vice President in a week impressing a woman named Susan Of course it's only a matter of time when the pressures of adult life begin weighing on him Josh turns away his best friend in favor of working and making money making new toy ideas...will he stay that way forever? The film still has a wonderful charm to it The sequence with the walking piano is my absolute favorite given it's filled with so much joy and passion There's joys to being a kid and adult but the two rarely go hand in hand, there's a time to grow up and to stay young, we shouldn't be in a hurry to be fully adult we can still appreciate our youthful days when we still can, what's more important our work lives or friends? And the film focuses on how a child's innocence can touch people making them realize certain things about themselves that, getting caught up in the rat race of life, they forget By todays standards this can't be remade but at the time it remains a heartwarming child's fantasy engaging even adult viewers on an intellectual level",4.5
Big,"Such an amazing film, one of the best by far.",5.0

Big,one of my all time favorites. Funny and sweet.,5.0
Big,"The restraint, especially Compared to a lot of major comedy movies these days, is really what sells it. Hanks plays the role amazingly both in the fun and in the more tender moments. I know the romance is necessary but I wasn't really sold and couldn't get past the adult woman unknowingly in a relationship with a child.",4.5
Big,Love this movie growing up. Everytime I went to a fair I was always hoping to find a machine like this. Still one of my favorite movies of all time.,3.5
Big,"Beautiful movie about growing up too fast. Tom Hanks plays older Josh, an awfully convincing teenager stuck in a grown-up's body in NYC. Big might not be one of the most outstanding movies in Hanks' portfolio and it might not be a tearjerker but it is touching in the delivery of its message. It also pleasingly funny in a more discrete way that showed from very early on Hanks' acting potential, which is why I believe this is one of my favorite body-switching themed movies.",5.0
Big,"That's so cool how they show the first iterations of computerized RPG games in the 80's. I can totally relate to this kid lol. The way his parents are telling him to do chores while he's trying to enjoy a video game couldn't be any more annoying. I love how they capture the nostalgia and aesthetic of being a gamer kid in the 80's. I like how creepy the Zoltar make a wish machine looked. Wow, a young Tom Hanks. Man, what a handsome guy, I never realized how nice his green eyes were. I bet this movie's going to be about growing up and how when we're young, we wish were older, and when we're older, we wish we were young. That was a great wide-angle shot of the Brooklyn Bridge. That hotel room looks like it belongs on the set of a horror movie, it looks so decrepit. I thought it was funny how the Puerto Rican guy starts yelling in Spanish into the hotel phone and Josh starts crying out of fear. I can also empathize with the fear that he's feeling, so at the same time I felt bad for him. 

How old was Robert Loggia in this movie? That was pretty impressive how he was able to play that foot piano so energetically and flexibly. It's funny how Josh became vice president of the toy company in just a week of being there by being himself and impressing the CEO with his piano skills. It's funny how the marketing guy of the company thinks Josh was sent from some other toy company. And even though the marketing guy is kind of the ""antagonist"", he was still funny. Omg, I love how the song ""Forget Me Nots"" started playing when Susan and Josh enter his apartment, iconic moment. I love the look and aesthetic of Josh's place, I'm definitely getting some inspiration from it right now. I loved that trampoline scene. Reminds me of how joyless adults can get as they get older and how important it is to remind ourselves that we're still alive. The younger playful versions of ourselves still exists in us and will always be a part of us. I love the way he joyfully strolls out of the elevator the next morning at work after having gotten laid the night before. 

The cinematography is actually outstanding, I'm kind of surprised by how well thought out and executed it was. I enjoyed it's playful and lighthearted tone. Although, I couldn't help but feel kind of disturbed and uneasy while watching certain parts of the movie, especially the hotel scene. It feels like they're trying to make commentary on child kidnappings and underage sex throughout the movie. It's oddly dark in that regard, but it doesn't really take away from the movie, it just acts as very dark side commentary. I loved Tom Hanks' playful portrayal of a kid in a grown up's body. He's got a great knack for physical humor and comedic delivery. This movie had me laughing really hard during some moments. The cast is full of charming and likable characters. I can't believe the movie got a PG rating even with the F and A curse words! My question is where is Josh's dad for all of this? We see him at the beginning and then he just disappears from the whole movie leaving only his mom as the only one who's actively worried about him. Not the strongest ending ever. I thought he was going to wish for himself and for Susan to both be kids again, but he only wished it for himself. Which I guess makes sense, he was prioritizing his childhood over being a grown up with responsibilities. Good choice Josh, good choice lol. There are several plot holes throughout the movie, but I guess we can just ignore those since the overall tone of the movie is silly and the premise is purely fantasy. Overall, it was a nice little 80's comedy. Although it didn't amaze me or blow my mind, it was fun and I had a good time watching it.",4.0
The Big Lebowski,Most overrated movie ever!,1.0
The Big Lebowski,"In my opinion, this is the greatest movie ever made. Brought to use by brilliant minds of the Coen brothers this comedy has so many layers each time you see it you find something new to appreciate. The music, the colors, the character dynamics, this movie is a certified clasic",5.0
The Big Lebowski,"It's amazing, the comedy and acting were some of the best I've ever seen in my life",5.0
The Big Lebowski,This film is modern Shakespeare at its apex,5.0
The Big Lebowski,"The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a throwback to a more idealistic age when students occupied buildings and imagined they could change the world. Sadder and wiser, The Dude now spends his time driving around in his increasingly-battered car, paying for a 69-cent milk carton by writing a cheque, downing White Russians, smoking pot, and bowling with his two friends, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi).

Bowling is a way of life for these men. The bowling alley and The Dude's dreams (in which bowling features a good deal) are filmed in bright and glowing colours, in contrast to the dingy lighting in The Dude's apartment. Stars feature heavily in the d√©cor. In his spare time, The Dude listens to bowling matches on his tape recorder. When these men are upset or distressed, they utter the refrain, ""F*ck it, let's go bowling"". This is their place of comfort.

Curiously we never see an actual bowling match, and we do not see The Dude or Walter playing a real game. (The Dude only plays in a dream.) Their arch-nemesis in the bowling world is a convicted paedophile called Jesus (John Turturro). He prances around in a camp manner, and he dances to a Spanish song which turns out to be a version of Hotel California by The Eagles. Despite this build-up, we never see a match between The Dude's team and his, and the outcome of the bowling match is left uncertain.

This reflects the intentionally ragged structure of the story, in which loose ends are only party tied up. We are led to expect the clich√©d final game between these two adversaries, which The Dude will naturally win, but the Coen Brothers do not provide this scene. For all the movie's love of bowling, it is only a background comfort, and not the real theme of the film.

The action of the movie is triggered when The Dude (whose real name is Jeffrey Lebowski) is mistaken for another man who has the same name. It is often intriguing how stories are sometimes triggered by seemingly trivial events. In the western Unforgiven, nine people die because a prostitute laughed at a client's small penis. In The Big Lebowski, a whole sequence of events is set in motion when a man urinates on The Dude's rug.

The urinator is a hood working for a local pornographer called Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). He is owed money by Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), a nymphomaniac trophy wife, who was reared on a clean, wholesome Scandinavian farm before coming to LA to become a pornstar. All of her appearances in the movie are marked by blaring music.

Her husband is the other Jeffrey Lebowski, the Big Lebowski of the movie's title (David Huddleston). This Lebowski is a millionare. As The Dude's apartment was broken into by Treehorn's men in a case of mistaken identity, The Dude decides to see if he can shake down his namesake for the money to buy a new rug.

The plot that develops from this situation takes The Dude down a long journey that includes a trio of nihilist crybabies, a severed toe, a marmot, a shamus, a TV writer on a dialysis machine, and a tin of Folgers containing cremated ashes. Despite the disparate nature of these elements, there is a broadly coherent plot holding them altogether, just as there often is in film noirs. This plot has structure and development, and can be easily outlined.

Nonetheless the convoluted plot is less important than the feel of individual scenes ‚Äì The Dude's exchanges with Lebowski, the sight of dazed-looking men tossing a naked woman on a blanket, the peculiar art installations of Maud Lebowski, the reactionary police chief who throws a cup at The Dude's head, and warns him to stay out of their beach community, and so on. This favouring of exciting episodic moments above the plot is another element that makes The Big Lebowski seem like a film noir.

The Big Lebowski is said to have had disappointing box office returns on its release, although it did make a profit with overseas sales. Nowadays it has become a cult movie, and has a strong following of enthusiastic nerdy fans. They hold Big Lebowski conventions, and there is even a religion of Dude-ism, based on The Dude's supposed philosophy.

This reflects the fact that many regard The Dude as a man worth emulating. The Dude may get agitated during the story, and he arguably finishes the movie in a worse condition than when he began, but we do not feel that his fate has been especially tragic, or that he emerges a diminished figure. He remains cheerful and accepting, and this allows us to accept him as a man who can come through life's pitfalls unscathed. Despite everything, The Dude abides.

Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are a fun duo, I even would've enjoyed this 1998 flick more if it was just those two for the whole near 2 hours. Everyone else on the cast is good too, amusing seeing Peter Stormare in a role like this - as opposed to one like John Abruzzi. Speaking of 'Prison Break', Jonathan Krantz is also in this!

The film starts like a house on the fire, I did find the rest of it - particularly the middle portion - a little (emphasis on 'little') less as the story is stretched out a tad, though all in all it gave me a good time and I'd happily rewatch it no doubt.",3.5

The Big Lebowski,"It's somewhat hard to understand why this is a cult classic. It is not a bad movie, atguably pretty good, but it's far from stellar

Funny at times, certainly unique and partially intriguing...unfortunately the story kind of nose dives towards the back half into a series of random and unimportant encounters. To some extent, I suppose this is a theme of the film...humanity lives, breeds and dies in what is largely a cosmic pool of chaos. Dude stands as a metaphor for humanity writ large in this sense (likely why his name is impersonal). This is a cool theme no doubt, but is inconsistently applied throughout the film.

As an aside...Cursing doesn't normally bother me...but this is a little much...feels like a cheap veneer to appeal to less intelligent viewers enjoying the movie for cheap thrills/content.",3.0

Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,"What a most excellent adventure. The best in the lot. One of the best comedies of the 80s.

Haven't seen this movie in ages. Let me tell you one thing, it still holds up well.  I love me some time travel movies. 

Having a phone booth as the vessel, was a genius movie. You always see some sort of vehicle be the Time Machine, so this was a most excellent touch.

This was well written, well acted, and given the time period, the special effects were decent. Reeves and Winter had excellent onscreen chemistry. (Good to know that they are really good friends in real life.) They somehow were able to get out of every situation, because the future them had already thought of the solution.

There is never a dull moment in this one. Perfect runtime as well. 

Being a history buff myself, I loved watching them travel to the different periods of time. My favorite, was the Napoleon scene. The most memorable scene of the movie for me (and tons of people) was the mall scene. Oh man, it was pure chaos and so much fun. Very, very, very 80s but done oh so well.

I always felt like Rufus (George Carlin) should have been more involved somehow. I don't know how they could've pulled it off, but I just wanted more from his character.

Well my dudes, this was a most excellent movie and you should definitely watch it if you haven't. If you haven't watched it yet, then what's wrong with you? 

Don't forget to Always be excellent to each other.

I watched it again about fifteen years later and boy was I wrong! This movie is a masterpiece. It is so freaking funny and even sweet at times. Nathan Lane is incredible in this movie. Really the heart and soul of the whole thing.,5.0
The Birdcage,"This was just fun and charming to the bitter end. I loved it, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are a great duo and I was invested in the characters and story beyond just a comedy too. Even the characters who were supposed to be the villains were fun to watch do their thing, I recommend it!",4.0
The Birdcage,Hilarious movie.  Great casting.  The writing is great.   Always fun to watch,4.5
The Birdcage,Robin Williams and Nathan Lane elevate this fun albeit predictable comedy into a smash hit owing to their brilliant acting prowess. The Birdcage combines heartfelt drama and whimsical humor to deliver a poignant message that's hard not to get behind.,3.5

The Birdcage,"I well recall seeing La Cage aux Folles in a theater and enjoying it enormously, just now catching this American remake. In a French film, you're never sure what's going to happen which adds to the excitement - nervous or otherwise - compared to an American film where you know everything will turn out just fine. In Birdcage, all the jokes seem to fall flat, the surprises are wrung out somehow before they happen, the pacing seems off/forced. There are fine performances to be sure, but they just can't save this version.",3.0

Blazing Saddles,"Just watched for the first time. Genuinely puzzled by how overrated this dross is. Maybe was hilarious in 1974 but in 2023 the humour is incredibly dated and, well, it just wan't funny. At all.

Blazing Saddles,"Blazing Saddles is a downright daring movie that might offend some people, but if you can look past that, you'll find one of the best Mel Brooks movies ever, some of the best gags and scenes ever- and perhaps one of the best Westerns ever. Overall: 9/10, only losing points because it's blatant vulgarity and offensiveness is going to scare some people off.",5.0
Blazing Saddles,"10% rating ... I've received a lot of hate for this, but I did not enjoy this film. I understand the theme of the humor, but for whatever reason I did not think any of it was that funny. I don't think this movie aged that well. Many will disagree with me.",0.5

Blazing Saddles,"A shockingly bold film for 1974, maybe moreso today.  The jokes were funny at first as they harkened back to better times and better films, but less funny as they repeated throughout.  That aside, it's a fairly routine western story with a twist ending.",4.0

Blazing Saddles,"Without question one of the greatest movies of all time. Anytime I see that its on, I'm watching till the end.
The cast was perfect. Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder were perfectly smooth together. Madeline Khan as the teutonic titwillow. Harvey Korman as the dastardly villan. Slim Pickens as Taggart was a perfect casting to have as someone authentic from westerns.
It is a movie that everyone should watch at least twice in their life.",5.0
Blazing Saddles,One of the best opening scenes bar none! Definitely a must see and without a doubt one of the top three comedies ever made,5.0
Blazing Saddles,"Awesome with a touch of hilarious. Way before the sjw indoctrinations, and woke people being offended by anything and everything, you had this. Created at a time when you could make fun of everybody and not be cancelled for the dumbest little crybaby snowflake nonsense. An epic western with jokes coming fast and furious. Gene Wilder was his usual nutty self and the whole cast nailed it. One of the greatest movies ever of any genre...a must see, and a must own.",5.0

If you don't know that, it will take you about a half hour, forty minutes to relax into it.  Cleavon Little is BRILLIANT, I don't know if he ever got the credit he deserved for his performance.  Harvey Korman is BRILLIANT.  So is Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder and obviously Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor, Andrew Bergman and the other scriptwriters.  Mel Brooks says this is his funniest picture and Young Frankenstein his best.  I would agree, definitely about this being his funniest film.",4.0

Blockers,"It's fun. I think a lot of the negative audience reviews are from people who wanted to see a movie about parents stopping young women from having sex, but then realized the movie is about the double standard our society treats women with. And much of America just isn't ready for that yet because they still think women should be controlled. These people aren't actually capable of growth so we just have to progress without them. The movie was funny and not too heavy. Give it a try. John Cena surprised me with how funny he can be here.",3.5

Blockers,"One of the biggest mixed bags I've ever seen. With some actual talent in the cast but one god awful script trying to imitate teens. Blockers has one or two good jokes from John Cena, who carried the entire film, but most are just cringe inducing filler. It's one of those movies that can be fun when watching with a group of friends, but is just boring filler when watching alone. The adults can be okay at times but feel overprotective and do stuff no sane adult would ever do to their child, but where did it go wrong when writing the teenagers? Why did the writers think it was a good idea making all their personalities just ""Horny""? All they can talk about is stuff you do under the sheets, they have 0 personality besides that. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna joke around with some friends and all have a dirty sense of humor.",2.5

The Blues Brothers,"It's the music, of course. The first time I watched this movie (in the theater) I was only impressed with the music.

Can't count the number of small lines that I have incorporated into my daily vocabulary.  Let's boogie, we'll talk to bob, you got my cheese wiz boy.",5.0
The Blues Brothers,This movie is such a fun experience. It is simplistic in design but grand in scale at the same time. The entire plot is merely a tent pole for musical numbers featuring real-life legends of blues and R&B. I genuinely wish this movie would be adapted into a Broadway musical.

You will find yourself giggling once in a while for different reasons throughout the entire film. It is a project that I believe was made for a younger audience, but anyone willing to be taken in his/her earlier days can enjoy it around a meal and some pop-corn. It is no ""Beef,"" nor ""Seinfield,"" but it is funny enough to be considered a worth watching comedy.",3.5

Only it even failed at that trope- none of the characters got around to feeling real. Watched it (as a Gen Xers) with our Gen Z teens, and they laughed a few times, too. But one said ""it was okay"" and the other ""didn't really like it"". I asked ""Do you know anyone who acts like that?"" -Nope. Okay, thanks-not just me being out of touch! Yeah, the so-called ""edgy"" stuff felt forced,  the ""heartfelt moments"" shallow, and the humor just cheap. The surreal moments were out of place in a movie that wasn't all-out weird and campy.

The music choices were really good (if not ironically funny in places), the two main characters had really good interactions, and heck, all the characters were fun. Contrary to other reviews, I don't think the other characters are supposed to be accurate representations of teenagers, instead they are exaggerated caricatures to make a point about teen culture. I'm also glad all the characters realized who were the people who actually care about them, it always bothers me when characters push others away. I also enjoyed the mixed-medium doll scene, that was pretty clever. The enemies-to-lovers part confused me, but that's just me.",5.0

Bridesmaids,"This comedy film written by Annie Mumolo
and Kristen Wiig and centers on a maid of honor, who suffers a series of misfortunes after being asked to serve as such, in the midst of a competition against a bridesmaid over who is the bride's best friend. With two Academy Award nominations (Melissa McCarthy for Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Screenplay), this absolutely hilarious film is what every modern comedy should be. It has genuine characters, clever improvised dialogues, ridiculously funny scenes and an ultimately touching original story of friendship that might be a bit over-the-top and cringy at times, but is just incredibly unpredictable and enjoyable. Also, it could still be Kristen Wiig's masterpiece as an actor and a writer.",4.0

Bridesmaids,"It's a little boring. I don't like millennial humor, sorry.",2.5
Bridesmaids,"A very fun and chaotic female friendship comedy.

Director Paul Feig's romantic comedy Bridesmaids (2011) is a real blast. It takes awhile to really get going, but I consistently was smiling and laughing. I was taken aback by Kristen Wiig's cringe comedy and leaning into the awkward moments. Feig's direction stands back to allow his excellent ensemble cast of actresses shine in standout comedic performances. I do think he could have cut this tighter to keep the humor more briskly cut because some jokes fell flat for me as certain jokes just kept going. Feig does direct with a chaotic fun loving energy that can get serious for the character drama. Bridesmaid is definitely worth watching for a funny comedy and lovable characters.

Writers Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo really focus on female friendship and how a lack of confidence can ruin your life. However, good friends can save your life and help you feel worthy and alive again. The gross out gags mostly didn't get an actual laugh out of me, but there's more clever jokes that I found funny. Bridesmaids feels hopeless, then hopeful with a sweet message surrounded by Wiig's irreverent and insane humor. She's so strange. She writes with an empathy for women down on their luck who are just trying to get by and I loved that. Her dedication to female friendship and supporting each other is a beautiful sentiment besides her crazy jokes that can be hilarious. Bridesmaids is about friendship and redemption at its heart.

Editors William Kerr and Michael L. Sale sometimes nail quickly cut comedy to perfection. Other times jokes fall flat when they are allowed to drag on without cutting away for awkward or cringe-inducing moments. They keep the movie fast paced altogether though. It does not actually feel like 125 minutes. Cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman gives Bridesmaids a sleek and colorful look that's nicely lit. I found every shot very pleasant to watch and gave each actress their spotlight moments in nice medium shots.

Kristen Wiig is excellent as the pathetic and awkward Annie Walker. I felt empathy for her wayward and despondent point in her life. Annie feels sympathetic because you know she's nice and fun, but having increasingly awful experiences that just make everything worse. I like that she gets to be a terrible person without a full redemption as a character. She just needs to mature and grow up to move onto a new chapter in her life with a helpful push from her friends. Wiig is a good actress and Bridesmaids shows off her romantic, comedic, and dramatic chops. I found her acting touching and compelling, even though the other actresses get to be funnier.

Rose Byrne is gorgeous and hilarious as Helen Harris III. The moment you see her you know she'll try to organize and control the wedding over Annie. I loved her incredibly funny and sincere performance. Maya Rudolph gets surprisingly few jokes and little screen-time as Lillian Donovan, even though she's the bride. The supporting actresses get far funnier material.

Melissa McCarthy is lively and friendly as the outrageously funny Megan Price. Bridesmaids is certainly her funniest performance. Ellie Kemper is so lovely and bubbly as the shy and repressed Becca. Her curious scene with Wendi McLendon-Covey's Rita is hilarious and unexpected. Wendi herself is a scream with her yelling at her swearing children and lamenting her miserable marriage. Chris O'Dowd is hilarious and nice as Annie's love interest Officer Nathan Rhodes. He steals all of his scenes.

Jill Clayburgh is sweet as Annie's funny and supportive mother Judy Walker. Rebel Wilson is funny, but basically forgotten about as Brynn. Tim Heidecker gets a cute cameo as Dougie. I wish he had more lines as Tim is normally super funny. Mitch Silpa's deadpan as Flight Attendant Steve is fun like Ben Falcone's bored and shocked Air Marshall Jon. Terry Crews gets a quick funny cameo as the yoga instructor Rodney. Franklyn Ajaye is quite sympathetic as Lillian's poor and supportive father.

Jessica St. Clair is so funny during the bridesmaids dress fitting sequence. Jon Hamm is such a creep as Annie's sleazy friend with benefits named Ted. Wilson Philips cameo to sing their uplifting pop hit ""Hold On"" at the end. Composer Michael Andrews makes a nice score for Bridesmaids, but I remember the fun soundtrack a bit more. Costume designers Christine Wada and Leesa Evans create really pretty pink and purple dresses for all the actresses. Make-up artist Heba Thorisdottir makes each lady shine with lovely aesthetics.

In all, Bridesmaids is a great time and I can easily see myself revisiting and enjoying it more the second time.",3.0
Bridesmaids,"This movie was straight booty, the only funny part of the movie was when everyone was pooping and barfing because it reflected the mood that watching this movie put me in. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ",0.5
Bridesmaids,"Kristen Wiig is one of the rarities from Saturday Night Live that was able to be great on the show and make the transition to films successfully. Bridesmaids was one of the best examples of this. It is more than just the use of a character, or trope, in a feature film. It is the use of a powerfully gifted comedian in a smart, funny role. It is the female counterpart to the male driven Hangover. Wiig is beautifully supported, and enhanced, by Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Ellie Kemper, and SNL's Maya Rudolph. Melissa McCarthy is shocking and funny in this one. She has some of the film's funniest scenes. Judd Apatow did a terrific job making a film driven by an all female cast that is not just for women. Jon Hamm has a small, buy very funny role in this one.",3.5

Bridget Jones's Diary,"A delightfully honest and relatable romantic comedy.

Director Sharon Maguire's romantic comedy Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) is a wonderfully sweet, constantly funny, and naturally endearing comfort movie for me. Maguire lets us get to know how miserable Bridget feels being single and irritatingly asked when she'll get married by family and strangers. I simply adore Bridget Jones's Diary and was surprised to see how it got middling to average reviews by many. I have rewatched it dozens of times for sure. I highly recommend it to be charmed by Ren√©e Zellweger alone.

Writers Richard Curtis, Helen Fielding, and Andrew Davies deliver a brilliant adaptation of Pride and Prejudice as a romantic comedy. It's so clever and funny with genuinely sincere romantic sentiment. I love that silly humor, raunchy style, playful sweetness, and earnest empathy for their characters. Bridget and her close friends are all wonderfully written. Martin Walsh's slick editing that ranges from cute montages of Bridget's pathetic wallowing in her own filth and loneliness to gentle cuts during her romantic encounters. Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh gives us fun perspectives to follow things from Bridget's view, alone at parties or work, with sleek close-up shots of her face. So, we're aware of how a man makes Bridget feel at heart. It's beautifully shot in hindsight.

Ren√©e Zellweger is hysterical and lovable as the quirky, awkward, and forlorn Bridget Jones. Zellweger can do romance, comedy, drama, and anything else with a massive range and good heart. She brings a natural beauty and effortless comedic charm. She's lovely and makes Bridget Jones's Diary special. Colin Firth is nicely understated as the dashing romantic hero Mark Darcy. His romantic chemistry with Zellweger's endearing romantic heroine Bridget is deeply felt by the audience. You always know he feels something deeper and wants to say something thanks to Firth's distraught facial expressions and uncomfortable body language.

Hugh Grant is hilarious and scandalous as the thoughtless fiend Daniel Cleaver. Grant has his signature easy going charm and quick wit to make Cleaver enjoyable to watch and so shocking to see his villainous behavior. He is simply one of the greatest romantic comedy actors we've ever been graced with with classics like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Two Weeks Notice, Love Actually, and Bridget Jones's Diary.

Jim Broadbent's kind and depressed father to Bridget named Mr. Colin Jones is so fun. Gemma Jones is just crazy as Bridget's single minded mother Mrs. Pamela Jones, wanting Bridget to get a man, while she herself is unsatisfied in her own marriage. Celia Imrie is funny as the wickedly inconsiderate Aunt Una Alconbury. James Faulkner is disgusting as the creepy Uncle Geoffrey.

Shirley Henderson is adorable and funny as the tragically crying Jude. Her high pitched voice always makes me laugh. James Callis is super funny as Tom, with his one-hit wonder pride and considerate kindness towards Bridget. She's just got the best of friends imaginable. Sally Phillips is very hot and hilarious as the ever swearing Shazzer. Lisa Barbuscia gets a cameo as the mean, but pretty Lara. Paul Brooke's perverted Mr. Fitzherbert is quite fun. Embeth Davidtz is gorgeous and funny as the selfish and cruel Natasha Glenville, who eyes Darcy for herself. Honor Blackman's cameo is very cute. I loved her in Goldfinger, so it's neat to see her here.

Production designer Gemma Jackson creates publication offices, Bridget's messy apartment, to pleasant manor estates with careful construction to make each place distinct. I liked Paul Inglis, Paul Cross, and David Warren's art direction for snow fallen sidewalks or Bridget's colorful home. Fergus Clegg and Shirley Lixenberg's set decoration plays books and colorful foods around Bridget's home for a cozy atmosphere and an emphasis on Bridget's personal style.

Composer Patrick Doyle's score is lively and bright. I like his romantic theme for Bridget Jones's Diary. The cute pop soundtrack is so funny and adds to the humor, such as for the iconic fight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Sound designers David Crozier, Glenn Freemantle, John Hayward, and David John make spoons clank as Bridget cooks or footsteps in snow press down with a nice sonic palette. Rachael Fleming's costume design is hilariously all over the place. Colin Firth's slick suits, Hugh Grant's ruffled fancy clothes, to Bridget's messy outfits. Zellweger wears more outfits in Bridget Jones's Diary than some actresses do in a lifetime. Make-up artists Carmel Jackson, Lorna McGowan, and Vanessa White let Zellweger glow naturally, but do give each actress unique looks with blush and lipstick.

In all, Bridget Jones's Diary remains 97 minutes of pure heart with lovable characters and endearing romance that anyone can relate to with ease.",5.0

Bridget Jones's Diary,"Loosely based on the old novel, this is the story about Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething British woman who is mateless and unhappy with her life, and keeps said diary to try to improve herself. The story begins when Bridget is invited to her parent's home on Christmas Day, and is introduced to a wealthy man named Mr. Darcy whom she dislikes. Later at her workplace at a publishing house, she describes the colleagues she also dislikes, and her boss has his eye upon her, and he seems charming. But she finds that he and the other man have a dispute between them, and her own boss perhaps is not the nice person he seems to be. Then Bridget's own mother has her own midlife crisis and is unhappy with her family...

Bridget Jones's Diary,"This movie is awful. Not only is it awful, it's downright insulting. The plot is insane and makes no sense from start to finish. The ending is not only stupid but actually sad - only it was supposed to be happy. To go into more detail, let's talk about the characters, since, to me at least, they are the main charm of rom-coms.
Bridget Jones is the most insufferable stereotype of a woman I have ever witnessed in media. She somehow manages to make the worst choices in every situation. Why go into television, and more specifically current news, if you're ALWAYS unaware of current affairs? Her character is honestly insulting to witness.
Mark Darcy may be good at his heart, but he is rude and I really do not understand why he's supposed to be a good pair with Bridget. This is why the ending was sad. She could've found literally ANY other man.
Daniel Cleaver... Well, he's supposed to be hateable, but he's so stereotyped and bland that I don't have much to say about him. I don't care about him. I ended up hating Mark more than him because Daniel is so... forgettable.
Bridget's father is alright, but the fact he got back with Bridget's mother after she literally left their house for the first man to notice her? And her asking HIM to make the effort after she literally cheated on him? No. That alone made me dislike them both.
There are only two good things I can say about this movie. It was funny as hell. When it wasn't too busy being nonsensical and insulting, it was very very funny. But that doesn't excuse the characters and shenanigans of the story itself. And the actors give great performances despite the poor character writing.

Tl;dr : This movie was very funny, but also stupid and insulting. ""Women are stupid and depend on men, and men are either bastards or pushovers"", says this movie.",0.5
Bringing Up Baby,"I believe this movie qualifies for the term ""madcap"".

Bringing Up Baby,"It starts off as an appealing comedy yet degenerates real fast. Yes, the animal action is really well done and the final stunt is cool, but the rest is an obnoxious train wreck of forced slapstick, endless hysteria and no dynamics - it's nonsensical mayhem all the time: no laughter comes out of that, just a fucking headache.

Bringing Up Baby,"A wacky, quick-lipped comedy from Howard Hawks, which foreshadows the director's sharper, later work on His Girl Friday. Bringing Up Baby follows a tightly-wound paleontologist (Cary Grant), out of his element on a fundraising mission, who crosses paths with an accident-prone chatterbox socialite (Katherine Hepburn) and her housebroken pet leopard. Grant's mild-mannered professor is immediately frustrated by the entanglement, but the more he struggles to extricate himself, the tighter he's bound. The girl is quicksand, basically, and she revels in the havoc she plays upon her unsuspecting prey. Eventually, somehow, the two develop a strong affection for one another, but not before they've ostracized a benefactor, misplaced a priceless fossil and spent a few hours behind bars.

Grant was no stranger to comedies (his collaboration with Hawks would continue in the aforementioned Friday), but this was Hepburn's first foray into the genre. Rumor has it she needed a little behind-the-scenes coaching, but she pulls her weight in the finished product and shows strong chemistry with her counterpart. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of laughs in the first hour, especially given the movie's age, but it wanes on the home stretch and I didn't really care for either of the main characters: one irritable wet blanket, one scatter-brained troublemaker. They get into some good scrapes together, but fail to redeem their intrinsic faults and don't quite merit the happy send-off they both enjoy.",3.0
Bringing Up Baby,"One of the most famous and greatest movie of Howard Hawks. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburne gave an amazing performance and compose a dazzlingly energetic couple, playing

Bringing Up Baby,"""Bringing Up Baby"" is a film I unconditionally love; it is so utterly sublime a comedy that I was truly sighing, awed, 'it can't get better than this...' at many points. Yet it regularly does; Hawks keeps the momentum going majestically; it is one incredibly surreal, bizarre tangent going off unexpectedly into another, at every juncture. He photographs and presents his actors in the most charming and amusing possible ways, and the film is certainly a more leisurely, perfectly pitched film than ""His Girl Friday"", which I nonetheless admire. There is a beauty in the photography and simple choice of perspectives and angles that matches the

There is not one actress in the annals of film who I adore more than Katharine Hepburn; she is a compelling performer, of great charm, intelligence and wit; of very real, idiosyncratic looks that to this eye are beautiful, vivacious, impish. In ""Bringing Up Baby"" her Susan Vance is a very interesting diversion from her more usual type of character - the slightly superior, in-control ice maiden, as shown in say ""The Philadelphia Story"". She is phenomenal in that film, yet here beguiling in a completely different fashion, playing a slightly scatterbrained, sprightly, charmingly delinquent woman, who seems to have no control over anything; least of all her feelings for Grant. Her giddy, breathless exuberance and anarchic helplessness are really endearing; it's a wonderful film that stretches out the credulity of Grant's wonderfully straight-laced character's resistance to Miss Vance. The ending is a gorgeous, satisfying pay-off, as he finally gives way, as would we all! It's a charming, suitable ending that rectifies the slight fall-off of the preceding jail section of the film. That is very amusing, but in a more predictable, slightly laboured way. In stark contrast to the first 70-80 minutes of the film, which amounts to about the finest sustained American comedy I have seen of that length - ""Way Out West"" and ""Duck Soup"" being shorter in total.

Cary Grant, truly an institution of a comedic player, is very different to his more remembered persona of later years. It's remarkable to see this absurd little man, bespectacled, unworldly and cutting an orthodox figure played so perfectly by the suave Grant. This is gleefully played on with the sublime scene where Hepburn and Grant are trying to catch the leopard - Kate butterfly net in hand! She accidentally happens to break his glasses and is even more taken with him without them... The tension between how we usually remember Grant and the character he is playing here does add an extra layer of amusement to the film. Need I really add that the rest of the film's company are note perfect? Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald and many more really give the perfectly matched stars a fine backdrop.

I shan't spoil too much of this heady, sublimely silly film... just go and watch it and see Howard Hawks, a master craftsman, at his best - there are no pretensions but making a quite wonderful character comedy - and Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on insurmountable form. With these delightful stars and anarchic, scintillating comic material, what we have on our hands is an unutterably fine film, one of my very favourites of all time. Where else are you going to get such plot threads running simultaneously as: a hunt for a rare archeological find buried by a dog, an absurd upper-middle-class family dinner and an escaped leopard?",4.5
Bringing Up Baby,"Arguably the greatest (and funniest and fastest) comedy ever made, for certain the ultimate screwball comedy, never surpassed in its madcap culmination of absurd and hilarious misadventures; with a perfect cast (Skippy and Nissa included) and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is breathtakingly immaculate.",5.0

On top of that, he has to get in good with a lawyer who represents a society matron who has $! million to give away...hopefully to his museum. Trouble is, a spoiled rich woman keeps getting in his way and interfering with his plans. And the woman even has problems of her own...what is she supposed to do with a tamed leopard (the ""Baby"" of the title) her brother just sent her? And the professor gets unwillingly involved.

Bringing Up Baby,"Bringing Up Baby - 10/10. Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, and Katherine Hepburn are some of the biggest and most successful people from the Golden age of Hollywood. Though each person had amazing careers later on after this film, Bringing Up Baby is a perfect example of a film that was well ahead of its time, and once it was appreciated, was considered as a masterpiece in its respective genre. The movie is probably the first film in the now super popular screwball comedy genre. Back when it came out in 1938, the film bombed at the box office, and even lead to having Hepburn losing out on film roles because of its unsuccessful initial run. But the film gained a better reputation as the film started playing on television in the 50s. Many films of today can learn a thing or two in the way the comedy is presented and delivered in this film. Grant and Hepburn play up the odd couple dynamic really well, with Grant's uptight nature and Hepburn's bubbly mannerisms helping bring a nice levity to the proceedings. The movie is littered with zany moments which feel over the top in the right way. What a lot of comedies do nowadays is try to make shocking moments that are so ridiculous, yet this film understands the perfect balance of zany and natural humour. Hawks provides the viewer with a quick and fast movie which translates really well all these years later. You're aware of it being a classic film, but it doesn't feel that way in the slightest. Time just flies by watching the movie, and its just a really fun time overall. Hopefully the movie never ever is remade, because I highly doubt anyone can top the performances that the whole cast gives in the film.",5.0

Broadcast News,"Broadcast News (1987) provided audiences with two impressive accomplishments.  The most important being a tight, well written, finely directed, and superbly acted story.  The second accomplishment was casting Holly Hunter in a role that would provide her with a break-out performance she was very deserving of.

Jane Craig (Hunter) is a high-strung yet remarkably talented news director.  She works closely with Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks), a news correspondent whom she respects and trusts because of his knowledge, experience, and integrity.  Aaron aspires to advance in his career but is held back because he's not as visually attractive as less qualified news employees and he lacks a confident demeaner.  Enter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), a good-looking former sportscaster who is hired by the DC area network where Jane and Aaron work. Tom has been hired as a prime time news anchor based on his viewer appeal, not his experience or knowledge.

Tom is everything that Jane fears and despises for the future of the broadcast news industry.  As profits become more important than integrity, the network places more value on style than actual substance and it seeks to elevate the inexperienced who poll better with viewers.  Tom admits that he often doesn't understand the topics he's covering, yet he succeeds because he has Jane and Aaron feeding him information and questions through an earpiece.  Eventually the three learn to co-exist, but their relationships are complicated when Aaron admits that he has romantic feelings for Jane, while simultaneously Jane is beginning to have a relationship with Tom.  

The characters are well defined, and the plot digs deep into that period in young professional's lives when they are out to change the world and spend so much time at work that it muddies their personal lives as well, an experience that most viewers can relate to.

This movie came out shortly after the first 24-hour news network (CNN) began airing.  Jane's fear of the future of news seems more real today than when the film was first released.  We now have several 24-hour channels that label themselves as news, yet their entire broadcast days are filled with nothing but opinionated commentary and there's not a single real journalist in sight.  In just the last few weeks we've learned that one of them (Fox) deliberately fed its viewers information it knew to be false, solely to increase ratings by telling much of its audience what they wanted to hear rather than what was true.  This is a much more egregious betrayal of journalistic ethics than the staged tears that Tom serves up in the film when interviewing a victim of rape.  A tear that would end his complicated relationship with Jane.  

This film, its creators, and performers are all deserving of the many award nominations they received.  It barely seems dated (ok, usage of VHS tapes aside!) and provides an extremely well crafted and satisfying ending.",4.5
Broadcast News,"Intense scenes of television newsrooms are alternated with intense scenes of the romantic lives of the protagonists, making for an intense workplace comedy.

Broadcast News,"Half an hour in, you're settled in and thinking that Broadcast News is going to be terribly conventional - a woman finds professional success but cries at her desk in a sense of personal unfulfilment, while being courted by both an ambitious (and ruthless) career man and a clever, emotionally resonant, and frustrated investigative reporter. Stay tuned to find out which passion she will choose to indulge, or if she will throw down her hair and declare herself a strong, independent woman. Fortunately, James L. Brooks manages to surprise with a story that is much more realistic, passionate, checkered, and entertaining.

The first aspect that stands out is the dialogue, which feels not only authentic but surprisingly witty, particularly whenever Albert Brooks gets to flex his comedy chops. You get a real sense of the frustration and the hopefulness, nailing home actual character development and a sense of legitimate drama that seemed poised at the outset to be destined for cheap pulp, soap opera-style conflicts. Holly Hunter gives such a good combination of professionalism and personal shortcomings, it's really wonderful to see in a decade that was painfully afraid to depict female characters in anything but positions of firm control, the slightest sign of realistic character design opening up accusations of sexism. More representation is great, but lip service alone would be derogatory towards women in film; it's the complex, human roles that really showed the acceptance of female characters in the medium. The ending might be a bit neat and defrays some of the supposed stakes of the main plot, but it's not like you're not happy seeing the epilogue that Brooks delivers.

Probably has to be among my favorite William Hurt performances as well, I'm just so used to seeing him play virtually the same character archetype of a dry, often emotionally pained 30-something  (Accidental Tourist, The Big Chill, even Kiss of the Spider Woman) that seeing some passion and happiness in one of his roles is a welcome change.

Neither did the endcap for this film which seemed like an awkward footnote that we didn't need, and could've been played in the background as the credits rolled, but overall this is a poignant take on what it means to be a journalist in the 80s.

Holly Hunter is great in this because she's just like Henry Rollins. Whenever someone meets Rollins they are shocked by how tiny he is because he's got a huge persona. The same goes for Hunter. She is a tiny little thing with one heck of a bang that bowls over the other actors around her.

Anyone who remembers this film is going to remember Holly Hunter crying, which is her character's ritual for cleansing the intensity she goes through minute to minute. No one on screen is as tightly wound as her character, which means when she lets her guard down, it really comes down.

You also see more behind the curtain of Oz in this than you do in ""Network"", as you see Brooks' character is smart and newsworthy, but he can't keep his jacket straight and sweats like a fraudulent Nixon on camera. William Hurt as his JFK-like nemesis understands his beauty almost too well, and struggles with the newsworthy when we find out he fake cried because he knows his fanbase responds to emotional reporting. 

""Network"" really builds rage for the industry of Oz, while this one pulls back the curtain in the most entertaining ways, showing the humans behind the media zoo.",5.0
Broadcast News,somewhat self-important but I enjoyed it,3.5
Broadcast News,"One of the James L Brooks greats, the writing, performances and general joy dished out to the moviegoer in Broadcast News marks a high point in 1980s filmmaking. Albert Brooks is at his strongest and while his flop sweat scene has become a cinematic comedy totem, the scene following with Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) is one of the most refined comedic and heartbreaking bits of scripted writing and actor's blocking that side of 1990. The film belongs to a certain era but with its humanity and degrees of human entanglement, it remains fresh and will continue to do so. Brooks' films aren't great visual masterpieces, but before The Simpsons, he honed in on family dynamics and a certain blend of comedy, truth and human suffering with an innate dynamism and entertaining combustability that captures us. In Broadcast News, you have a narrative that continues to surprise us. It's not an action film's twists and turns, but the turns of life, the subtle turns that still feel monumental while living them. In the highs there are lows, and in the lows there is heart and for that, this film (and Terms of Endearment, alike) will probably forever remain relevant. It's a simple joy, watching humans with flaws exist and try their best, and in Broadcast News you have 3 gifted actors doing just that. You won't have to try hard to enjoy it.",4.5
Broadcast News,"The three leads, Hunter, Hurt, and Brooks were expertly cast and are what drive this film forward but it is the infectious personality of Holly Hunter's character that I will most remember as I found her performance quite captivating. Among the conflicts faced by Hunter's character both personally and professionally it was her resistance to the newer and more emotionally manipulative form of ""news"" stories in favor of the more traditional fact based news reporting that I found most interesting and quite prescient for 1987. Those who wonder how ""news"" got to where it is today can (aside from looking in a mirror) see, with a much wider perspective, this evolution and change in public perception with regard to ""news"" when experiencing other forms of media from the past.",4.0

Broadcast News,"In 1987 I was just beginning an experience of working for a local newspaper in the city where I was born and I, at the age of 21, was hired to diagram the pages of that local newspaper.
What I always remember until today of that little adventure in journalism was not necessarily my job, but how exciting it was to be a part, even if indirectly, because I didn't have much experience with that media. The reporters were arriving at night with the news around 7 pm and debating with others the issues that will be on the next day's edition.
That same year the film ""Broadcast News"" directed by James L Brooks and with a cast of top actors came on the cinemas showing very effectively what happened behind the scenes of a TV network also about journalism. For my pleasure and somewhat differently, that world represented in the film became very familiar to me.
From the speed with which we had to work and make headlines for everyone involved to close that newspaper just before midnight and without delay with the utmost care with the content and quality of the information. Who knew that integrity today would be a thing of the past ... what a pity!
The film is more complete in the sense of being a very authentic and original comedy in the sense of the three main actors had a relationship between themselves and together quite abnormal and in this view at that moment when I found myself also seemed similar because I remember some small conversations (there was not much time for long conversation) in which the editor in chief complained about the problems he had with his wife who demanded more attention from him in married life and he always said he did not have time. Perhaps that is why in the film everyone at the beginning is solitary and very poorly solved with personal dramas that were reflected all the time and since high school that is shown at the beginning of the film when the actors are presented in young versions. The film even invites us to a reflection that as we get older we believe until today that the experience makes us better people but I don't think that is what the film shows us. More stubborn they have become.
The film also shows a very incoherent and even absurd love triangle but that is the most interesting part of the film's script. We have producer Jane (superb Holly Hunter) who is immensely strong and talented but who cries every morning before leaving for work her best friend Aaron (Albert Brooks in one of his memorable performances) and colleague who secretly sows a withdrawn and unrequited love simply because Jane does not imagine him as a kind of boyfriend and finely Tom (William Hurt one of the best actors of the 80s) athletic and handsome, very ambitious and unintelligent but who will not measure scruples to achieve the dream position of almost any reporter ... anchor of the evening newspaper and in the process Jane's heart.
Not to mention the supporting cast, this is equally sensational with a cameo Jack Nicholson. But it is the hilarious script (also by James L Brooks) that remains current, keeping the technology differences of our current world with the one that used to keep this film fresh and funny until today.
This film brings back great memories of a decade when there were social problems like today but there were also information professionals with a certain concept of not compromising their particular vision on the news and in the most impartial way possible, without deceiving or hiding the truth. and seek to promote a smarter public debate always in the sense of seeking solutions as a community and together achieving better results.
Even though we are simply human beings with the defects that Tom, Jane and Aaron had but they also just tried to be happier. Thanks for the memories for the drama and laughter.
Here you can also find my video log CINEMIN dedicated to the film. Thank you.

It was also nominated for Best Picture.  Great Character development with a Great story.  James L Brooks is at the top of his game with this film.",4.0
Broadcast News,"This one felt kinda half-baked for me. The story has some genuinely funny moments as well as a few pointed bits of media critique, but the whole thing is overall too focused on Holly Hunter's love life to pack much of a wallop to stand the test of time. 
I know its not fair to judge it by today's standards, but the big climax being Hunter breaking it off with William Hurt over some phony tears on camera is borderline laughable. I only wish that were still the biggest journalism sin one could commit.",3.0

In Bruges,very funny and witty. Been meaning to watch this forever now. Hilarious ending aswell,3.5
In Bruges,"A film that possesses a virtually impeccable balance between it's lighthearted and humorous tone and its deeper, more emotional storytelling. It's a thrill throughout and although it starts off somewhat monotonous, it picks itself up incredibly quickly and manages to produce both a heartfelt portrayal of guilt and a comedic take on the 'hitman' business.

There's rarely a dull moment in the film which is much thanks to the remarkable chemistry between Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, their continuous bickering amongst each other that often creates some hilarious interactions is always a joy to watch. Much of the dialogue in this film is outstanding and the pace at which the tone of a conversation can shift without feeling abrupt is spectacular. There is always a purpose to the dialogue, whether it be as simple as a moment of comedic relief expressed by a dwarf or another insight into Ray's failure to reconcile with himself.

Themes of moral ambiguity, depression and guilt are often strong on their own but Martin McDonagh combines them to create an incredible story shrouded in uncertainty. When there isn't witty remarks and comical insults being expressed but instead powerful dialogue about principles and the afterlife, the film is able to convey an emotional story that is both engrossing and eye-opening.

Bruges, a setting that while despised by Ray, presents a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere that much of the film revels in. The setting of the film often amplifies the feelings of sorrow and guilt that Ray has been overwhelmed by with it's quiet alcoves and peaceful streets, there's a sense of loneliness in the air that is both melancholic yet serene, suggesting a sense of redemption awaits Ray.

Carter Burwell produces a stellar score that complements the atmosphere and tone of the film immensely but at times, certain scenes can feel lacking when there is no soundtrack to support them as if that scene could've improved severely had there been a supporting piece of music.

Overall, a captivating film throughout that manages to find the ideal balance between dark humour and evocative storytelling due to it's impressive script and compelling themes.",4.5

The level of foreshadowing makes you want to watch a few times over to understand the dark humor and complexities cultivated throughout the film.",5.0
In Bruges,"Genuine, witty, emotional. Even hilarious at times, without taking away from its point. The last act stretches a bit long with its pacing, but in the end it pays off. The setting in the ""fairytale fucking town"" in Europe makes the background scenery perfect for a completely unforeseen, mindful deconstruction of the typical shootout action movie, and that's exactly what it successfully delivers.",4.0
In Bruges,"One of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, never met anyone else whose seen it. But, if you like sarcastic, dark humor, it's an absolute must. Seen it fives times now, like it more each time. Colin Farrell takes a lit of guff, but people forget he's a real actor.",5.0
In Bruges,"Now I've heard of In Bruges when I was a teenager and I also heard about how offensive it is with it's jokes and such. But on the other hand this is a dark comedy thriller like it's supposed to and it stars some good cast with Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes which both in the Harry Potter films apart from Colin Farrell. All right, let's get on with it. Two Irish hitmen, Ray and Ken played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, have been sent to hide in Bruges after a failed assassination attempt in London by their employer Harry played by Ralph Fiennes. Ray thinks Bruges is a s**thole. In church he shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a little boy. He saw that they're shooting movie in Bruges with a dwarf actor in it. He's attracted to Chlo√´ which he takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and ends up knocking them unconscious. Chlo√´ takes Ray to her apartment but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray takes the gun of Eirik and shoots him in the eye blinding him. Now as a dark comedy I'm aware that there are some jokes in this are offensive involving dwarfs and black people. Speaking of dwarfs, Ray mentioned Herv√© Villechaize from The Man with the Golden Gun. I have to admit that years ago I watched the ending on Film4 channel. Now for the movie itself I really enjoyed it. It's darkly comical, it's well scripted, well acted and well put by Martin McDonagh. Well, I'll tell you something. If you never heard of Bruges before or don't know what that term is, well, take Hercule Poirot for example. It's in Belgium.",4.5

Burn After Reading,"Whoever put the trailer together knew how to bring the audience in. Pity that the director then didn't put together a film that lived up to that expectation.

This film is a really slow burner. For a relatively short film, the first half introduces multiple characters and storylines and it is quite difficult to see how everything is going to come together. It feels that there are at least three different films running simultaneously. A good bit of editing could have seen 15 minutes taken off this for a pacier start. There would have been no real loss to any character development as the characters are pretty throwaway as it is.

The film then ramps up a pace in the second half and starts to deliver on the expectation. Everything starts to come together and it feels like that it is going to deliver.

And then,  the ending. Well, if you call that an ending. It felt to me as if the budget money had run out and you were left with a story that really really didn't make much sense.

Burn After Reading,"The style of this movie is very different from the feeling and normal pacing of a Coen Brothers movie, but it is still very good. What is retained is the quirky, unusual nature of the characters. John Malkovich is sharp and funny. George Clooney reminds us here that in addition to being a great action and dramatic star, he is also very funny. Here he plays an awkward buffoon, rather than a sex symbol. Malkovich's separation from the CIA, his pending divorce, and memories set the stage for this crazy film. Brad Pitt offers one of his quirkiest, funniest, and best performances here. Frances McDormand is her charming and engaging self as the woman whose desire for immediate cash for her plastic surgery sets the entire series of crazy events in motion. Richard Jenkins and Tilda Swanson round out the great, great cast.  Direction, cinematography, and the script are always high level in Coen Brothers films-true here too.",3.5
Burn After Reading,"We're supposed to acclaim all that the Coen Brothers do, but they really laid an egg on this badly plotted would-be spy comedy that misused great actors like Clooney, Malkovich, Swinton and even a young and callow Brad Pitt, who's simply ridiculous in this.

City Lights,"Alright, so here's the thing about ""City Lights"" ‚Äì it's an oldie, but oh boy, is it a goodie! This film is Charlie Chaplin at his finest, and if you haven't seen it yet, you gotta rectify that, pronto!

First off, this film is a silent movie. Yes, you heard that right ‚Äì no dialogues. But the beauty of it is that you don't need words to understand the story. It's a simple yet deeply emotional tale of the Tramp ‚Äì Chaplin's iconic character ‚Äì who falls for a blind flower girl. Simple plot? Maybe. But it packs an emotional punch that could knock out a heavyweight boxer.

The humour in ""City Lights"" is slapstick comedy done right. It's Chaplin's trademark, after all. You're gonna laugh out loud at the Tramp's antics and his never-give-up attitude. And there are scenes that are pure comedy gold. But then, just when you think you've got the movie figured out, it hits you with some truly poignant moments that'll tug at your heartstrings.

Chaplin's performance is absolutely top-notch, and he shows that you don't need words to tell a story. His expressive face does all the talking, and man, does it speak volumes. He makes you laugh, he makes you feel, and he makes you root for the Tramp all the way through.

The final scene ‚Äì just wow! No spoilers here, but let's just say it's one of the most beautifully crafted endings in film history. And trust me, it's gonna stick with you long after the credits roll.

So to sum it up, ""City Lights"" is a must-watch. It's a masterclass in storytelling, a perfect blend of comedy and drama, and a testament to Chaplin's genius. It might be a silent film, but it speaks louder than most of the talkies out there. Don't miss it!",5.0

The story may be considered silly or simple to the modern viewer, but this film has humor, it has heart, and it has drama. Even the acting, while intentionally hokey most of the time, brings real emotion in the end.

This is the 3rd film of Chaplin's I've seen and I don't regularly rate movies higher than an 8 on IMDb but there you have it.

City Lights,"One of the most famous and best work of Charles Chaplin that has such profound heart and joy as it does comedy. This is another film that is a pleasure to watch and is timeless in every possible way. As the talkies were exploding in Hollywood and nearly everyone was making the switch, Chaplin was nearly done with City Lights and after great debate decided to finish it. Thank God he did though, as this is one of his greatest achievements, arguably his best, and a masterpiece of the Silent era! City Lights delivers in all the key areas and provides Chaplin's usual touch of humanity and his loveable demeanor coupled with his impeccable timing and hilarious slapstick. Currently sitting at #11 on the current American Film Institute Top 100 Films of the past 100 years, City Lights earns that spot by leaps and bounds. What an amazing work by one of film's most talented Director/Actors. If you haven't seen it you are missing out on a gem and need to do so as soon as possible!",5.0
City Lights,"I agree that this is Chaplin's best performance, but I don't think it's his best movie. The third act, particularly the boxing scene, was flawless, but for more than half the movie I felt the scenes weren't blending into each other very well and (especially in the first act) he was milking the decent jokes through bald repetition. The length of the boxing sequence really saves the movie as that whole part is perfect from start to finish and it taking up a significant amount of the runtime was good. It does make it rather difficult to justify AFI naming this the #1 rom-com though as the whole thing is like 5% romance at best.",4.0
City Lights,"""City Lights"" represents the apex of Chaplin's artistic brilliance, creating an achingly beautiful window into a panorama of comic scenarios that are as heartfelt as they are funny. The film is the truest evocation ever envisioned of everything embodied within the term ""sublime,"" all distilled and purified by the silent film medium to a point of perfect simplicity. The emotions here are so frankly and honestly portrayed in pantomimic fashion that sentimental moments hit us straight in the heart, leaving us laughing and weeping in equal measure. Never before have I witnessed a spectacle that so readily accesses my emotions, ever astounding me with a vision of human endeavor that transmutes every painful and funny moment into a thing of truly rare beauty. To be moved by the little tramp is to recognize his innocence in all of us, enticed by the purity of his comic struggles to briefly set aside the cynicism that can so quickly reduce us to a tired and jaded condition. ""City Lights"" is nothing less than quintessential Chaplin, offering up as complete a picture of his brilliance as one could ever hope for.",5.0

City Lights,"For adults who want to show children a purer form of comedy, City Lights is your movie.  This sweet but comic slapstick classic shows Chaplin deceiving a blind flower girl to gain her love.  It is a fun movie and a valuable one.  If you've never seen a silent film, this is the one to see.  It teaches the lessons that appearances can be deceptive and a man with nothing to his name can be as honorable as any millionaire.

As an actor, Chaplin is a marvel, conveying astonishing emotional depth through the silent antics of his little tramp.  As a director, he demonstrates an impeccable sense of timing with difficult, gracefully choreographed stunts.  The entire family may bust a collective gut watching him skitter across a slippery dance floor, or outmaneuver an imposing boxing opponent, but then be rendered speechless by the poignant ending.  To blink while watching is to miss something.  Like Modern Times, another masterpiece, this film touches on some sensitive issues but doesn't become weighed down by them.  A morose drunk man makes repeated suicide attempts, although the audience never feels the danger.  

This was a thumb in the eye to talkies by Chaplin and is perhaps his best film ever.",5.0
City Lights,"Maravilhoso, sens√≠vel e cativante.",5.0
City Lights,"The importance of Charlie Chaplin films cannot be overstated, and City Lights always pops up whenever you discuss his best. A classic blend of slapstick and pathos, the kind that The Tramp character was always associated with, I did laugh a number of times, but I also spent significant periods waiting for something significant to happen. It's obvious how talented Chaplin was, and he dedicated himself fully to his craft, and while the material he comes up with is usually amusing, he seems to have trouble filling out an entire film. Some scenes, including the prelude to the boxing match, and the match itself, go on for much longer than they should, and just start repeating the same jokes to diminishing effect. It's a fun story, and The Tramp's hapless antics are always bolstered by the fact that he is, in essence, always trying to do good, never hurts anyone out of malice, and ultimately is just trying to get by in a difficult world. Maybe Chaplin's style of comedy isn't to my taste, but I certainly appreciate how much he did for the world of Cinema at large, and there's certainly a lot of elements to recommend. Not to everyone's taste, but it's still a landmark film that any movie buff should see at least once.",3.5

My favorite part was when the flood happens and they save the cow.Sadly some of the characters I would have liked to have for the whole movie didn't stay but I still like the 3 main characters Mostly didn't like the part that if you watched the movie you would know what I'm talking about, but I did like the character development.

City Slickers,"Billy Crystal. Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby star as three best friends all in some sort of mid life crisis or crossroads, who go on a trip to participate in a cattle drive.  Haven't watched this in quite awhile and forgot how good it is.  Funny and heartwarming with some fantastic scenery.  Jack Palance also was excellent in his supporting role as tough as nails cowboy, Curly.   Enjoyable revisit.",3.5
City Slickers,"City Slickers is one of the reasons that films from the early 90s were so great.  Many films from the early 90s revolved around adult themed troubles and no one did it better than Billy Crystal.  Crystal had nearly 3 decades of being at the forefront of the comedic world, but in the late 80s and the early 90s, he really stood out on his own and made many enjoyable movies of the time that have become much more relatable at my current age.  The writing, directing, and acting in this film was stellar and I miss these perfect storms of film making as many of the films today have some of the parts, but never everything it needs to be great.  Because we decided to talk about this film 30 years later on our podcast, it's evident this film has stood the test of time and is as relative for GenXrs today as it was for our Boomer parents back when the film was released.  I'm giving this movie an absolute PLAY, and a part of me assumes everyone else in the world does as well.  If you didn't care for this movie, then I'd argue you're dead inside and have no soul.

Ridiculous and  yeah film is ruined by that kind of nonsense.",2.5
City Slickers,"Movie will be out of 62 points
This movie is good, but it definitely has a lot of slow parts in it. I wished the movie was a bit more exciting when the cast was in the West, as there was no energy for me even when the characters were there. I liked Billy Crystal in this film. He was really funny and the rest of the cast was good too. I thought Jack Palance as Curly was good. He did win an Oscar for this film, but I don't agree with his win. being that to me he did not have a moving experience, and he had very little screen time, for me to judge. The movie definitely has some silly parts, like when Billy Crystal helps give birth a cow. That part  made me laugh a lot! It was mostly very entertaining of a film, and I did like it! It was also very fast-paced despite with some slow moments!
Final grade: 45/62= 73% C-

City Slickers,The funniest treasure-hunting comedy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0
City Slickers,"It‚Äôs kind of weird returning to City Slickers now that I‚Äôm actually older than the characters in the film. I can appreciate some of the stress that comes with getting older, and I guess I understand the desire to seek out adventure before it‚Äôs too late in life. It does seem like the message of this movie is fairly vague, bordering on being a complete cop-out that dodges any true moral, and therefore it lacks some of the emotional punch I was expecting. I enjoy all the camaraderie between the main characters, and seeing how they grow closer through this adventure. I‚Äôm not sure I fully believe that they could become as good at herding cattle as they seem to get in a matter of days in this film, but it certainly gives a triumphant tone to the end of the story. Unfortunately, that tone lasts less time than I expected, and never feels fully satisfying. There‚Äôs no doubt that City Slickers is an entertaining movie, and it works because the 3 best friends all have charm and good chemistry with one another. I like the diverse characters we see from Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby. I‚Äôm not sure all the humor in the film works, though. There are several moments where I chuckled, but it fell short of laugh-out-loud funny. Of course, I have seen the film before and knew most of the jokes were coming, so perhaps the humor just lacks the kind of punch needed for repeated laughs. The strangest attempt at humor is just Billy Crystal‚Äôs repeated nasal ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù I‚Äôm not even sure why that‚Äôs supposed to be funny, but he goes there again and again. On the whole, City Slickers is still a decent comedy-adventure film that explores the causes and effects of a man‚Äôs mid-life crisis. It‚Äôs not an all-time classic, but certainly worth watching.",3.0
Clerks,"It's hard not to have a soft spot for a low budget movie, made for $26,000, that generated a dozen, or so, films and launched the film career of Kevin Smith.   This low budget, realistic, comedic look at some convenience store Clerks in a suburban New Jersey town trying to navigate sexual relationships, coming of age, and figuring out what they want to do with their life.   Considering the low budget the characters and the Direction are substantially better.   The movie doesn't;t try to be something it is not.   The strength is in the characters and the dialogue.  This is an important piece of cinema, actually.",3.5
Clerks,"Clerks is considered an amazing movie for several reasons. Released in 1994, it marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Kevin Smith and quickly gained a cult following. Here are some reasons why Clerks is celebrated as an exceptional film:

Authenticity and Relatability: Clerks portrays the lives of two store clerks, Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, who work at a convenience store and a neighboring video rental shop, respectively. The film captures the mundanity, frustrations, and humor of working in dead-end jobs, resonating with many viewers who have experienced similar situations. The characters' conversations and dilemmas feel genuine and relatable, making the film highly engaging.

Dialogue and Wit: Clerks is renowned for its sharp and witty dialogue. Kevin Smith's script is filled with clever pop culture references, rapid-fire banter, and Clerks, Kevin Smith's directorial debut, is an absolute masterpiece that remains as fresh and relevant today as it was upon its release in 1994. This black-and-white indie film takes audiences on a hilariously insightful journey into the lives of two store clerks, Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, as they navigate the challenges and absurdities of their dead-end jobs. Clerks is a remarkable achievement that deserves recognition for its authentic storytelling, razor-sharp dialogue, and its undeniable impact on independent cinema.

One of the most striking aspects of Clerks is its sheer authenticity. The film captures the essence of working-class life with such accuracy that it feels like an intimate glimpse into the lives of real people. Kevin Smith's script is a marvel of observational comedy, presenting a never-ending stream of witty banter, pop culture references, and astute social commentary. From debates about Star Wars and the ethics of contractors on the Death Star to discussions on relationships and life's existential dilemmas, the dialogue is sharp, engaging, and endlessly quotable.

Despite its modest budget, Clerks showcases Kevin Smith's talent for visual storytelling. The black-and-white cinematography, while initially a practical choice due to budget constraints, becomes an integral part of the film's aesthetic, lending it a gritty and raw quality. Smith's use of long takes and static shots creates an immersive experience, allowing viewers to feel like flies on the wall, witnessing the daily grind of convenience store life. The minimalistic approach accentuates the characters and their interactions, ensuring that the focus remains squarely on their compelling stories.

Clerks is a testament to the power of independent filmmaking. Made on a shoestring budget, the film overcame its financial limitations through sheer creativity and resourcefulness. Its success resonated with aspiring filmmakers, proving that passion, talent, and a captivating story could triumph over big-budget extravaganzas. Kevin Smith's achievement in bringing this raw and unfiltered narrative to life has inspired countless filmmakers and has become a touchstone for the indie film movement.

Beyond its artistic merits, Clerks has left an indelible mark on popular culture. Its characters and catchphrases have become iconic, and the film itself has become a cultural touchstone for Generation X and beyond. Clerks captured the disillusionment and apathy of a generation and turned it into a cathartic, laugh-out-loud experience. Its subversive humor, unflinching honesty, and irreverent take on societal norms challenged the status quo, leaving an enduring impact that has spanned decades.",5.0

Clerks,"I well remember watching this film as a teenager when it first came out. Then it was a true low-budget indie where the total lack of production values just seemed to enhance the whole thing and cement its perfection. The black and white photography, the total lack of a set, the unprofessional actors, it all just works marvelously. The movie is a series of anecdotes in the lives of a convenience store clerk and another clerk at a neighbouring video rental store. It chronicles all the different customers who come in throughout the day and their daily drudgery of ringing people up, changing light bulbs, and getting fined by the state for selling cigarettes to kids. There is a kind of overarching emotional theme as one clerk - Dante - confronts his ambiguous love life and grapples with the way his life is going nowhere, but mostly it's a series of hilariously funny and intellectually stimulating dialogue that unfolds throughout the day. It is a classic and one of the great examples of fantastic filmmaking on a shoestring budget.",5.0

Behind the camera, writer/director Kevin Smith makes a brilliant debut on a shoe-string budget, relying mostly on a sharp script and dialogue, complete with some classic jokes (37 will remain one of the funniest numbers ever thanks to this movie).

She sees herself at the top of her high school food chain even thinking she‚Äôs doing good for others. She hatches a plan to get two teachers together and even bring a new student, Tai into the ranks. Perhaps though she‚Äôs created a monster making a better version of herself. Now Cher has to find something that truly makes her happy and not come off as superficial. Even her ex-stepbrother pushes her to see her true colors amidst all the glamour, materialism, and popularity. The actors were actually teens during filming which says a lot given Hollywood these days casts 30 year olds. So many quotable lines and cultural references. Cher is dim witted but her intentions are in the right place. Love Dionne‚Äôs character by Stacey Dash and the late Brittany Murphy as Tai. It‚Äôs true sometimes even we can be clueless about life, love, and feelings. It is funny how Paul Rudd hasn‚Äôt aged a day since. I‚Äôve never seen the tv show or the stage musical. But this became one of the most popular teen flicks of the 1990s. It made Alicia Silverstone a rising star becoming an iconic figure.",4.5

Coming to America,"One of Eddie Murphy's best comedies from the late 80s He's headlined by a great supporting cast of Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, Shari Headley, Louie Anderson, and Samuel L. Jackson John Landis makes a fish-out-of-water comedy about a Royal who just wants to feel free In the nation Zamunda Prince Akeem is obligated to choose a future queen But he wants a woman that stimulates him on an intellectual level rather than physical He and his buddy Semmi embark to America to find a suitable woman He's not quite used to things in the big city of Queens so he dons a disguise as a foreign exchange student working fast food A young woman named Lisa he falls hard for but also keeping his title a secret Akeem is likable cause he values a woman's opinion not just to have a wife that'll obey his every whim, he‚Äôs naive, optimistic, and innocent Lisa is likable too being an advocate for black awareness and politics yet she doesn't want her entire life planned out by anyone This was also one of the first instances Murphy played multiple roles by himself The film even offers a different view of Africa itself; it's not a desert land by any stereotypical means but rather a palatial estate very opulent bathed in wealth and beauty The costumes and set designs are so intricate and elegant Is it always tradition for men to have power?, no journey is too great when one finds what he seeks, love should matter more than status or decree, finding someone that matches you is more important than by fancy titles Think of this as a reverse-Cinderella going from riches to rags Heck there's even similarities between this and Black Panther as far as the cultural influences showing there's more than just pre-conceived notions about its peoples This is a bit stagnant at 2 hours since you know a majority of plot points but still you can tell Murphy works some of his best chops",4.5

Coming to America,"I don't think it is John Landis's best film or anything, but there are a lot of very likable things about this film. I agree that when the film slows down, some the jokes do too and the pacing lags slightly then. That said, it is confidently directed, has a sweet story and the jokes that work do outweigh the ones that don't quite. The film looks good too, with some interesting locations and lush cinematography and the soundtrack is memorable. Eddie Murphy does a fine job carrying the film and manages to be very likable, not to mention some fun cameos of his courtesy of clever make-up. Arsenio Hall is good too, and it is wonderful to see James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair again, same with scene stealers Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy.

Coming to America,"Solid comedy. Coming to America gives an interesting storyline about an african prince trying to find a wife in America. Eddie Murphy does a great job in this film and really boosts this film. James Earl Jones gave a good performance as a demanding father who didn't want his son to find his own wife. Nothing necessarily special about the film, but just a solid watch with some good jokes here and there.",4.0
Coming to America,"Coming to America is a fun comedy flick that highlights the main cast, spotlighting the incredible performances by Eddie Murphy throughout the film, and his ability to always create a mixture of seriousness when needed and comedy. The film was really enjoyable, with a great score composed by Nile Rodgers, amazing comedy and inventive parodies of the real world, great costume design and a very likeable main cast of characters with charming actors who play their roles greatly. The chemistry between Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall allows them to be more fluent with their comedy and come off more natural, making the film more funny and compelling. The main character Akeem is created to be very likeable, with his great morals and ideas of being both a hard worker and wanting people not to like him for his status, but for who he really is. Coming to America is able to capture the gritty and grimy nature of Queen's, using bleak and dirty colours to juxtapose Africa's bright colours, contrasting the attitudes and status between the two places. Despite the movie playing off as being a romantical comedy, the inspiring story of Akeem is what takes the forefront of it for me, as I found it far more compelling and humble, with the scene between Samuel L Jackson and Akeem being my favourite in the movie, as it shows his pride and care in his low paying job. The music utilised in the film relates heavily to African culture, and is very catchy and easily to dance along too. The acting and multiple roles Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall take on shows how versatility they are, but I find they can struggle to grip the audience during there more grounded scenes, as their scenes can quite easily end up becoming a gag at the end of them, ruining any kind of seriousness the scene had. In the end, the film is about a humbling prince who just wants to find true love, a compelling story that can be relatable, and is a fun journey that goes by so fast.",4.0

I know, perhaps, I'm veering away from the film here but we have to stop thinking that being super rich is important.. it's just ego and vanity.. also the film isn't good.. the acting is wooden.. and all I'm thinking throughout is that flying first class is a nonsense that nobody needs.. big houses are unnecessary.. we will all, in the end, be the same.. food for worms.. everything else is superficial meaningless fluff.",1.0

The acting is really good also, with lots of charm and chemistry. But there isn't much depth to anyone and a lot are one dimensional. The editing is the biggest weakness. It's decent editing and cuts fast but it's constant ""And Than"" the ENTIRE time. It helps it follows only one night but many of the characters never even come together to form a bigger whole. And granted it feels like stuff just happening is the point and it succeeds at that and making it entertaining and putting us in a night in 76' but there needed to be a tighter narrative, less characters or underlying commentary. This is very similar to Robert Altman films but not as tight. This leads to decent pacing as it feels like it starts to run out of steam but it isn't long. The camerawork is excellent and the settings are memorable and overall the cinematography is very good. It never feels like short stories and everyone is experiencing the same night in the same location but it feels a bit much. I honestly wish we would've focused on the one 8th grade kid the entire way instead of constant jumping. The directing REALLY saves this from being a unfocused mess. It's a fun time but it isn't for everyone and honestly a bit overrated. Anyone who is a fan of any actors in this, coming of age stories, or the director will like this.",4.0

Although I was born 30 years after the time when the film is set, I get nostalgic thinking about how times have changed from my current high school experience. I have watched this movie countless times and will continue to because of the way it allows me to escape from the reality of a technology obsessed world and see what it would be like to live in different decade. Everything about the film is perfect in my eyes- the incredible music, the lovable characters, the dialogue, and especially the way that even without a main story line it has conflict and resolution. A masterpiece!",5.0
Dazed and Confused,"Cute and nostalgic.  I recall seeing this around the time it came out and not liking it.  The movie is very unstructured and probably was too close to my own high school experience at the time.  But looking back, it was definitely not my high school experience, but it certainly is reminiscent.  I certainly felt for all the characters as they struggled to find their place amongst their peers, suffering the indignities and joys along the way.  Again, there is no real story, just a bunch of kids on the last day of school looking for a party and a place to get high with friends.  no doubt inspiring work like That 70s Show, it has the trappings and soundtrack of the time, although honestly, the time is irrelevant.  I think the 70s hook probably helped rope in young adults who had graduated 10-20 years earlier.",4.0

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"""Don't make me crawl around you. The sand is too hot.""

From the premise to the upbeat score, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels feels like a film out of time, made 30 years prior with equipment from the future. So classic in its sensibilities, a battle of wits between two delightful characters with a screwball flavor. Steve Martin and Michael Caine are never really thought of as a duo, but it makes sense - the charming buffoon vs. the refined man of taste; together they have excellent chemistry as they go from distant strangers, to teacher and student, and finally rivals locked in a competition of deceit. The story is nominally about criminals willing to stab one another in the back, but is somehow never cruel; even when someone gets a leg up on another it's always taken in stride. Martin is at his best with his ability to switch back and forth from sarcastic swindler to Three Stooges routine, and Caine forms an effective counter even though he's really the straight man of the duo. The plot developments aren't necessarily earthshaking and start to fall into place before the final reveal, but that doesn't make them any less fun to watch. 

Functionally, it's not necessarily to everyone's tastes but in sructure should be considered one of those perfectly designed comedies, one of the best of the 1980s that doesn't feature Leslie Nielsen or a ZAZ team member. (4/5)",4.0

Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,It has been a while since I literally laughed out loud so consistently in a movie! This film is a hilarious and shockingly relevant satire that does not pull any punches. The scenes where the president is on the phone with the mysterious Dimitri are some of the funniest I've ever seen. It's also got a lot of slow parts that seem to drag on; a person can only watch mundane airplane operations for so long before one starts to question their sanity.

Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick and featuring the incomparable Peter Sellers, is a cinematic gem that seamlessly blends dark comedy, political satire, and social commentary. Released in 1964, during the height of the Cold War, the film's genius lies in its ability to tackle the terrifying topic of nuclear warfare with razor-sharp wit and satire. In this article, we will explore the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick, the exceptional performance of Peter Sellers, and decipher the underlying meaning and symbolism behind this satirical masterpiece.
The Brilliance of Stanley Kubrick:
Stanley Kubrick was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his uncompromising artistic vision. Dr. Strangelove showcases Kubrick's unparalleled ability to navigate complex subject matters and present them in a thought-provoking and entertaining manner. The film's technical excellence, precise cinematography, and masterful use of black humor exemplify Kubrick's genius.
Multi-Talented Peter Sellers:
Peter Sellers's performance in Dr. Strangelove is nothing short of extraordinary. Playing three distinct roles, including the titular character, Sellers displays his incredible range and comedic timing. From the bumbling Group Captain Lionel Mandrake to the deranged ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove himself, Sellers effortlessly embodies each character, leaving an indelible mark on the film's comedic brilliance. His ability to switch between nuanced performances showcases his versatility as an actor and highlights his immense contribution to the success of the film.
The Dark Comedy in Dr. Strangelove:
Dr. Strangelove is widely regarded as a dark comedy masterpiece. The film's humor arises from the absurdity and irony of the situation it presents‚Äîa rogue U.S. Air Force general orders a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, triggering a cascade of disastrous events. Kubrick skillfully uses satire and irony to highlight the absurdity of the Cold War mentality, military bureaucracy, and the potential catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons.
One of the key elements that make the film's humor so effective is its juxtaposition of serious subject matter with comedic performances. Kubrick's decision to cast actors known for their comedic talent, such as Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, adds an extra layer of wit and charm to the film. By presenting such a grave topic through humor, the audience is simultaneously entertained and forced to confront the gravity of nuclear warfare.
Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb stands as a testament to Stanley Kubrick's visionary filmmaking and Peter Sellers' exceptional talent. Through its dark comedy, the film skillfully satirizes the Cold War era, nuclear weapons, and the inherent flaws of human nature. It uses humor as a vehicle to explore serious and frightening subject matter, forcing the audience to confront the irrationality and potential consequences of nuclear warfare.",4.0
Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"After seeing this movie for the first time after watching 2001, a clockwork orange and, the shinning, I was surprised by this film. Historically put in context this film was far and away describes the nuclear fears during the Cold War, clever jokes hold up like ""no fighting in the war room"" but others fall flat. There are some parts where I can see the comedians trying to be funny but it just doesn't work for me 100% of the time. 4 1/2 stars with half a star missing because I don't see myself watching it again anytime soon, and I don't like the ending personally.",4.5
Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"This movie really shows how interesting and exciting an hour and a half of people sitting around a table, talking about action can be. You would expect in a movie like this to be bored while they are talking, and relieved when the scenes in the plane show up, but I actually waited for those scenes to end so that I could get caught up with the news and information being talked about in the war room. The soundtrack has one song played multiple times in slightly different variations, and it is very interesting. It is definitely very different than other Kubrick movies, and if I didn't know better, I wouldn't have guessed it was one of his movies, but even though it was different, it was definitely excellent.",4.0

Dr. Strangelove is an amazing movie to look at, but the story didn't fully work for me entirely. The performances of everybody are great, George C. Scott was the highlight for me personally. Stanley Kubrick created a pretty funny movie in my opinion, but still with a serious tone underneath it. The movie is pretty ridiculous at times, a bit to much at places for me personally, but overall it's an enjoyable movie and one about a subject, that will automatically create tension for the viewer and is intriguing to look at.",4.0

It is essentially one of the best satirical comedies out there. Peter Sellers was hilarious here in no less than 3 roles. My personal favourite was the president. My favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as Dad and I watched this at midnight and couldn't stop laughing. I loved Sellers also as the man in the wheelchair Strangelove, who tries to impersonate Hitler, I think. There was a brilliant performance from fine actor George C. Scott, who I really admire. I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent. Got to love the music, I did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. Great movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox",4.5

How could EVERYBODY miss Sterling Hayden's Jack D. Ripper? Not once can I find him mentioned in the comments. He isn't even named or pictured in the cast list! You wouldn't know he was in the movie. It's an outrage. The scenes that have stuck most chillingly in my memory for 55 years are the stark, single-light up-from-below shots of him puffing on a cigar, calmly explaining that he has set off the nuclear end of the world because of the Communist plot of fluoridation.

Slipping this fine dish of a movie out on the marked at the very top of the cold war,which itself was  a strategic bold move.

Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"This film features a lot of dry wit and is a good piece of political satire. I liked how the various people, representing different aspects of the US (the military etc.) and other nationalities, are put together in close quarters in the war room, which inevitably lead to some clashes. This isn't the sort of film that offers lots of immediate laughs but I appreciated the quirky characters and there are certainly some rather amusing pieces of dialogue, one famous quote being 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'. 

I found the phone calls made by various officials particularly amusing. One conversation features an official arguing with the person on the other end of the line that 'I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are' and consequently going off in a huff. There is a pointed sense of immaturity portrayed in the way that such people communicate with one another, which makes you think about the potential childishness, the one up-man ship aspect of war and of political confrontation generally I suppose. I found it somehow amusing that one of the characters kept referring to the Russians as the 'Ruskies'.

I liked the various characters played by Peter Sellers. His characters are, unsurprisingly, quite comical in tone and have an edge of caricature about them. The film has a serious theme (the threat of nuclear war) and it does well at making us think what could happen. It has some distinctly comic moments within the script but it also poses some important questions, makes the viewer see the somewhat sinister side of megalomania and its certainly decent as a piece of thought provoking cinema. The fact its filmed in black and white is also quite well judged, I feel, as it gives it an almost timeless feel to it. The film dates from the mid 1960s, when most films were shot in colour as standard and given the very modern danger that was an all out nuclear war, at the time this film was made and initially released, its perhaps ironic that its shown in a normally quite dated way but it does give it a timeless feel somehow.

The plot is a bit meandering and it won't appeal to everyone but I'm glad I've seen it twice now as I feel I appreciate it more now and the first time I saw it, I really wasn't in the mood for this type of film (political satire) and indeed I stopped watching after half an hour or so. Given I saw the drama show Catch 20 recently, I could see some similarities and perhaps better understand where its coming from.

I would recommend this to people in the mood for such a film, not an all out laugh a minute comedy or a light and easy watch as such and not for people hoping for constant fast paced action or war scenes but otherwise its a cult classic that I'd say is worth a watch.",4.0

Duck Soup,"A truly timeless humor that I originally assumed wouldn't be funny, but always has me laughing out loud. That said, this ultimately feels more like a series of comedy skits than a cohesive movie with a narrative through-line. The peanut/lemonade vendor scene is one of my favorites and such an excellent showcase of the Marx brothers' physical comedy chops.",3.5
Duck Soup,"This movie is wretched. I hated every moment of it almost universally. I've liked other Marx brothers films in the past, but this was profoundly upsetting. As satire goes, it feels as pointy as a sponge. The humor almost never feels like it's appropriate to the conversation or scene going on, and I literally laughed twice during the whole movie. Apparently, I'm in the minority here, but from where I'm sitting this movie blows chunks and I wish I could get the hour and change of my life I spent watching this back so I could watch paint dry, or pick lint from between my toes or do literally anything else.",1.0
Duck Soup,"A crescendo of madness and increasingly silly slapstick comedy.

Director Leo McCarey's slapstick war comedy Duck Soup (1933) is a real pleasure even nearly a century later. McCarey's direction delivers musical numbers, slapstick routines, and verbal satire for a delightful comedy classic. I appreciate Duck Soup more as the older I get, the more I understand and enjoy all the verbal jests. McCarey makes Duck Soup a real blitz of humor that slams its way into your heart. Duck Soup is a tight 69 minutes thanks to editor LeRoy Stone's slick cuts directly from joke to joke without missing a beat. 

Writers Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar, Arthur Sheekman, and Nat Perrin provide humor lambasting nationalism and blind patriotism for brilliant satire years before Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. I loved the clever verbal jokes from Groucho and Chico, especially the silent comedy from Harpo. The physical comedy and slapstick stuff still works effortlessly to get tons of laughs. Henry Sharp's cinematography has tons of wide shots with only a few select close-ups, so that we catch all the visual set-ups and gags.

Groucho Marx spews out tons of witty dialogue as new leader of Freedonia Rufus T. Firefly. I like that even if a joke goes over your head, Groucho just moves onto the next gag or bit of wit without losing a step. He's excellent as the idiotic political leader. Harpo Marx is hilarious as Pinky the silent spy. His prop work, cutting things in half, and messing up is excellent mime work. Silent comedy often ages well and Harpo's visual gags had me screaming. Chico Marx is a riot as Chicolini the spy with quick wit and a neat foil for Harpo to play off. Zeppo Marx aids Groucho's humor as Firefly's secretary Lt. Bob Roland. He complements Groucho's smarter humor nicely.

Margaret Dumont is great as the uproariously silly sponsor of Freedonia Mrs. Gloria Teasdale. Her jokes opposite Groucho work well. Louis Calhern is excellent opposite Groucho as the constantly insulted Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Raquel Torres is super pretty as the femme fatale Vera Marcal. I loved Edgar Kennedy's blowhard, blustery lemonade vendor. It's great that half of Duck Soup has nothing to do with politics and is just Chico and Harpo ruining a lemonade stand vendor's entire life.

Composers Harry Ruby, Arthur Johnston, Bert Kalmar, and John Leipold play around with boisterous army marching orchestral music. I liked Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar's satirical patriotic songs.

In conclusion, Duck Soup is hysterical and clever for a timeless piece of satire and slapstick alike.",5.0

Duck Soup,"This is a very madcap, zany comedy, which I thought was quite amusing at times. It highlights the ironies of war. Its regarded as a classic - I wouldn't say its something I'd want to watch again but it is certainly entertaining and so a reasonably good watch.",3.5
Duck Soup,"Probably the Marx Brothers' most famous comedy, ""Duck Soup"" is a hilarious and wacky slapstick comedy that even manages to take a stab at politics. Groucho plays Rufus Firefly, who is appointed the new president of Freedonia. He has a dubious stance on work ethic and attempts to cut work hours by reducing the length of employee lunch breaks.

Mrs. Teasdale, who has donated twenty million dollars to the failing country, becomes the object of affection for Rufus, who has to battle for her hand against Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country Sylvania. Soon their tumult escalates and war is declared between the two countries.

Most people who comment on this film seem to indicate that they saw it at a very young age and have grown up with it. I can honestly say I wasn't given the opportunity to ever see it until recently, when I finally managed to watch it on Turner Classic Movies, completely uninterrupted.

Although it is not consistently laugh-out-loud, tears-in-your-eyes hilarious, ""Duck Soup"" is very funny - and not quite as outrageous as I had expected. There's a lot going on here, aside from silly physical humor.

The Marx Brothers are great as usual and as usual Groucho steals the show.

Ultimately if you've never seen this, you need to go rent it out right now. If you have seen it, you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made.",4.5
Duck Soup,"This is not only the Marx Brothers' best film, it is also the greatest political satire of all time.  Groucho plays the leader of Freedonia.  Harpo and Chico play his spies.

Duck Soup,"I don't like Duck Soup as much as A Night at the Opera (my fave Marx film), even though this one is the more unhinged and anarchic.

Duck Soup,"Duck Soup is an appropriate appetizer for anyone who is interested in delving into the comedy of the Marx Brothers.  The plot, which is really a secondary issue when it comes to any movie with the Marx Brothers, involves Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) taking over the presidency of Freedonia and the inevitable mayhem that ensues.  Really‚Ä¶that's about it.  The humor is based primarily on puns and slapstick, the former provided by an inspired Groucho and the latter provided by Harpo and Chico.  The humor is truly a mixed bag and there is generally about one laugh for every ten misfires, but they come fast and furious.  The antics of Harpo and Chico get a bit tiresome, but it is all part of the package when it comes to the Marx Brothers.",2.5
Duck Soup,"Chaplin's prevalence in the silent era has likely led to his particular brand of comedy becoming more universal and longer-lasting, but the Marx Brothers were the champions of comedy in the '30s, and much of their output still feels funny today, especially the visual bits. Groucho's delivery seems dated in spots for sure, but the film is still among the best of the decade, and a landmark of early comedy in sound. In many ways, the antiquated vernacular is part of the charm. Zeppo sticks out like a sore thumb compared to his brothers, though. (4/5)",4.0

Duck Soup,"This comedy does not age well at all. Not even worthy of a smirk. Annoying songs, annoyingly bad one liners, annoying slapstick. The whole thing is dross. Laurel and Hardy were and still are exceptional. This is the first and last Marx Brothers film I've watched. Awful.",0.5

Acting: 10

Beginning: 10

Characters: 10
Main character Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is absolutely hilarious. He has quips for days and he's always doing something to liven up a scene. The other characters, while good, get lost in the greatness of his funny antics.

Cinematography/Visuals: 10
Numerous setpieces abound here which keeps the movie fresh. The movies's consistent change of scenery and large visual spectacles propels Duck Soup to almost passable heights. I can appreciate a movie with a constant change of pace, especially older films.

Conflict: 3
I spent a decent amount of this movie trying to figure out just what exactly was going on. The conflict never seemed strong enough for me to think the stakes were worth it. It was clear the focus was more on the comedy aspect rather than driving the story.

Entertainment Value: 8

Memorability: 3

Pace: 10

Plot: 7

Resolution: 5
The ending was meh and that's me being generous. It was essentially a compounding of the story as a whole which totally lost steam for me towards the back half of the movie. it felt like, by the time we reach the end, the writer forgot what initially made the story great in the first place.

Overall: 76
When you don't really know what's going on right off the nose, it makes it hard to settle into the story. Duck Soup does a lot of things rights. However, a solid main character and grandiose scenes aren't quite enough to mask the fact that the movie falls just shy of being good. Not terrible, but definitely not great.",4.0

Dumb & Dumber,"A Classic Comedy. It basically is a road trip comedy mixed with a screwball plot with gross out humor, slap stick, and stupid gags that works really well. The music is the weakest part, its decent enough but really needed to be more memorable and distinct for such a ridiculous over the top movie. Everything else is actually very well done. The only issues is the villain is super forgettable at the end, the plot kind of gets very shaky at points especially in the second half as it gets a little convoluted, and sometimes stuff can just sort of happen though most of it works well. The road trip only lasts a little under half the runtime and switches up, so they know there is only so much you can do with that. The slap stick is really well done and Jeff Daniels has amazing chemistry with Carrey. Daniels does a good job of being funny without Carrey and is really in my opinion the reason this works so well compared to other Carrey comedies. Carrey tends to go at lighting speed with jokes and it can get old quick or very hit or miss eventually. Daniels slows it down and gives us a break and balances him out really well. Also, it just boils down to its very funny and well executed slap stick and mindless stupidity that's kind of clever at the same time. 90% of the jokes work and get either a chuckle or a big laugh and there are plenty of visual gags. Sometimes Carrey can get a little bit much at times though. Anyone who is a fan of any actors in this, the directors, or comedies will like this a lot.",4.5

Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"This is one of the quintessential teen comedy of the 1980's. It is adult themes and sexuality in a coming of age comedy. The film, without question, contains one of the most iconic teen sexuality, fantasy scenes in the history of cinema; one starring Phoebe Cates. The characters and comedy are larger than life. They may not seem like real high schoolers, but it works. The film has simple themes of navigating high school, coming of age, and trying to nuance dating and sexuality. Most of the cast has gone on to do other things. The stand out is Sean Penn; his career has been so significant and it really started here. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Ray Walton, and Judge Reinhold are all very watchable here.  It, actually, has aged well.  Look for a bunch of young actors in small, bit parts, like Forrest Whitaker throughout.",3.5

It plays like a sitcom as a group of teens navigate their way through high school.  The laughs are sparse, the situations are paint-by-number, and the outcomes are predictable.  The cast is interesting and features a heap of stars at the beginning of their careers (Penn, Judge Reinhold, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates and small roles for Forrest Whitaker, Nicholas Cage, and Eric Stoltz), but beyond that it is all pretty forgettable.",2.5

Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"A simplistic and overly romanticised depiction of teenage life, filled with unrealistically drawn characters delivering self-conscious, contrived dialogue that no human would ever utter, with overly simple views of the world. A film like this needs acute observations of human psychology and behaviour, especially when treading in the self-contradicting world of the teenager. A film filled with future megastars, but no better for it. A disappointment when it rates so well. It requires a low level of expectation to survive, which is possibly why some rate it so highly: they saw it with the low expectations of a teenage audience, and look back on it with nostalgia.",2.0

Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"I think Fast Times at Ridgemont High would've benefited from leaning more into either its comedic or dramatic side. Instead, it teeters somewhere in the middle and doesn't give a viewer in 2021 more than a few funny (and even iconic) moments and a heavy dose of nostalgia for Gen Xers. While I wasn't yet alive for peak 1980s ""mall culture,"" (most recently exploited in season 3 of Stranger Things), there's something for even us 90s children to appreciate ‚Äî upgrade some of the arcade games, change a few chains in the food court, it's basically 1995. Perhaps some of the content was edgier in 1982, like when Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Linda (Phoebe Cates) are practicing giving blowjobs on carrots in the cafeteria or when Stacy gets an abortion, and I can appreciate that, even if it doesn't pack the same punch now. What is evergreen, however, is the most recognizable character of the film, Sean Penn's ""Spicoli"". The epitome of the Cali surfer/stoner stereotype, Jeff Spicoli is still a gem and the ""pizza delivered to the classroom"" was just as funny as I remember when first watching this movie in the mid-aughts. I even remember James Franco's Pineapple Express character, Saul Silver, being lauded as ""the next Spicoli"". The other iconic scene, Brad's (Judge Reinhold) masturbatory fantasy of Linda emerging from the pool, soaking wet and shedding her bikini top, has been parodied several times, most memorably in Fountains of Wayne's ""Stacy's Mom"". There's definitely a few laughs mixed into the coming-of-ageness plot. It's a movie you should watch in the summer, even though it takes place over the course of a year ‚Äî that's Southern Cali for ya. There's better out there in this genre for you to find, but FTaRH might be exactly what you're looking for.",4.0

The First Wives Club,"Delightful revenge enacted by righteously furious wives supporting each other.

Director Hugh Wilson's comedy The First Wives Club (1996) delivers empowering humor that is hilarious no matter how many times I've seen this movie. I think The First Wives Club is hilarious and laughed heartily throughout this delirious romp of feminist perspective and satisfying vengeance. I hope any girl or woman who sees The First Wives Club feels seen and empowered by its clever wit and relatable scenarios. I'm glad there's a wonderful film to help girls feel beautiful, loved, and valued on their own terms and that they don't deserve to be cheated on by a jerk guy or dumped for a younger girl. As someone who hates seeing sexist men have their way, it was cathartic to see these awful men get their comeuppance at the capable hands of Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton.

Writer Robert Harling brilliantly adapts Olivia Goldsmith's novel The First Wives Club. Goldsmith's concept is fantastic with three women finally fed up with being treated horribly by their husbands, so they decide to enact cold revenge in a series of crazy situations. I love how the writing here feels completely unironically sympathetic towards the women and their plight. It's not just about feeling bad for them, but about how strong and supportive their friendship is and how they can have fun while seeking vengeance upon their cowardly, gross ex's. It's really about empowerment and finding success in its uplifting messages and scenes of understanding each other's pains, while showing how ladies cooperating will always thrive. The jokes feel as timeless as The First Wives Club's messages. It's a riot.

Goldie Hawn is a gorgeous burst of energy as the hilarious actress Elise Elliot. Her insecurity over her aging career and botox injection looks is endearing, but its Hawn's chaotic vibe and frenetic energy that gets me hollering. Goldie Hawn is one of cinema's funniest actresses ever. She's so lovable and fun in The First Wives Club, whether she's exercising while scheming or casually entering her ex-husband's office to sell off his desk and decorations, Hawn nails the woman savoring revenge perfectly. Her line delivery, funny faces, and effortless physical comedy are a blast to watch throughout The First Wives Club. Hawn makes it look like she's not even trying to be funny, while being hilarious. She's as funny in The First Wives Club as she was in Shampoo or Death Becomes Her. I adore Goldie Hawn.

Bette Midler sears the silver screen with her furious tirades and funny criticisms of the fashion industry standards to sleazy men. Midler's Brenda is a riot, especially once she's extorting her ex-husband. Diane Keaton starts out very meek and apologetic, then comes into her own as the empowered Annie. Maggie Smith is fun as the posh fashion designer Gunilla Garson Goldberg, especially when she's pulling one over Sarah Jessica Parker's eyes. Sarah Jessica Parker herself is hilarious as Shelly Stewart. Her shallow girl routine is hysterical, especially opposite Dan Hedaya's whole sleazeball act as Morty. Hedaya nails that cheap scumbag cheater type.

Stockard Channing is very sympathetic in her cameo role as Cynthia Swann Griffin, who commits suicide due to her awful husband leaving her for a young woman played by Heather Locklear. Victor Garber is easy to hate as the horrendous blowhard Bill, who is taking Hawn's Elisa for everything she's worth. Stephen Collins is such a creep as Annie's cheating husband Aaron, especially in his scenes with a sultry and manipulative therapist played by Marcia Gay Harden in one of her most sizzling roles. Elizabeth Berkley is so sweet and playful as an aspiring actress named Phoebe LaVelle. Bronson Pinchot is so fun as designer Duarto Feliz with his nervous persona and frantic antics. Jennifer Dundas is very fun and modern as Annie's lesbian daughter Chris, who is sick of her horrid father mistreating her mild mannered mother.

Rob Reiner has a great cameo as Goldie Hawn's plastic surgeon with his honest takes. Ivana Trump's cameo really seals the deal when she appears to speak the film's tagline into existence. Take him for all he's worth would have sufficed too for this movie's mantra. Gloria Steinem even cameos herself at the shelter for battered and abused women in the end for a feminist icon. Timothy Olyphant has a great cameo as the director insensitively casting Goldie Hawn as a mother instead of a heartthrob lead actress. J.K. Simmons cameos as one of the FBI agents arresting Morty in an early career moment.

Editor John Bloom neatly cuts between all these parallel stories to clearly tell you who is a part of what scheme. I found his editing coherent and slick without ever wasting time. The dramatic scenes are allowed to breathe, while the comedic sequences are fastly cut and keep the laughs coming. Cinematographer Donald E. Thorin nails the close-up shots that have to feel empathetic and serious for the dramatic moments in The First Wives Club. I love all the wide shots reveling in the revenge of these ladies as you see every aspect of these production designer Peter S. Larkin's home and office sets that are getting sized up for sale. Set decorator Leslie E. Rollins found the tackiest and gaudy furniture for the rich estates and the sweetest home furnishings for the working class households. All the pictures, paintings, and statues of Goldie Hawn in her home are to die for honestly.

Composer Marc Shaiman's pleasant score emphasizes the absurdity of the comedy and the sincerity of the dramatic revelations with his sweeping orchestration and gentle melodies alike. Costume designers Theoni V. Aldredge, Hartsell Taylor, and Michael Adkins give each lady clothes that look pretty and flattering, but that they'd actually wear to keep in theme with the film. Goldie Hawn, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Marcia Gay Harden look particularly lovely in The First Wives Club. Make-up artists Angela Levin, Bernadette Mazur, E. Thomas Case, and Marilyn Carbone flatter each lady with blush on Parker and Hawn to a more natural look for Keaton to ensure each character feels unique to their personality.

In all, The First Wives Club is 102 minutes of quick wit and uplifting delight. The charismatic and touching performances from the astounding ensemble cast really shine.",5.0

A Fish Called Wanda,"I don't think this aged that well, but it's often funny.

Director Charles Crichton's crime comedy A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is decently funny.  It can be hilarious in certain scenes, but drags on a bit too long and doesn't feel that clever. I liked the general premise of trying to get a key to stolen loot, seduce information out of a lawyer, kill off an elderly lady witness, and idiot crooks making mistakes. Writers John Cleese and Charles Crichton have a healthy sense of absurdist humor that works best with the dry British humor bit. Kline's ravings are funny, but his idiot insecurities as Otto are not that funny to me. A Fish Called Wanda is trying to be the old comedy classics The Ladykillers or The Italian Job. It's just not on their level.

Casting director Priscilla John got some very strange and eccentric actors for A Fish Called Wanda. Jamie Lee Curtis steals every scene as the flirty and clever femme fatale Wanda. Her getting horny over men speaking Italian is fun like her wild seduction scenes. John Cleese is fun as the dry British barrister Archie. 

Kevin Kline is way overacting as the idiot robber Otto, who hates the English and thinks he's an intellectual. I do not understand who could have voted for Kline for Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars. Michael Palin is hilarious as the stuttering thief. His animal lover feeling worse and worse after killing dogs is so funny. He just wanted to feed his fish in peace. Maria Aitken's stuffy British style, Tom Georgeson's silly crook Georges Thompson, and Cynthia Cleese's astonished Portia are all fun supporting characters.

Editor John Jympson cuts crazily for a swift 109 minutes, but some erratic scene transitions. Cinematographer Alan Hume uses smooth panning shots in each scene that gently moves the camera through sequences. He uses natural cinematic lighting with a bit of a hazy look to A Fish Called Wanda. Production designer Roger Murray-Leach creates quaint homes and law offices like the pretty art direction from John Wood. Set decoration from Stephanie McMillan puts all kinds of cute props and ugly furniture for the homes.

Stunt coordinator Romo Gorrara pulls off some wild car driving. Composer John Du Prez's film score ranges from lovely airy classical music to goofy 80's synths that bumble about like one of those television commercial tunes. I liked sound designers Jonathan Bates, Gerry Humphreys, and Chris Munro do some neat work with The Doppler Effect as sound fades in and out when cars and trains rush by here.

Hazel Pethig's cute outfits for Jamie are so playful. Hairstylist Barry Richardson gives Jamie Lee Curtis a cute pixie cut and messy hair for all the sleazy crook men. Makeup artists Paul Engelen and Lynda Armstrong give each guy sleazy and greasy mustaches and scruffy looks.

In all, A Fish Called Wanda is pretty funny and silly, if hopelessly over the top.",3.0
A Fish Called Wanda,It definitely holds up!,4.5
A Fish Called Wanda,"Aged 15, I went to the cinema to see this - with my parents. A very literal schoolboy error, my mother walked out; ate always was more of Fawlty Towers than a Monty Python type. My Dad and I stayed, though I got confused and never did with out if I actually liked it.

Now, distanced from offended parents and critical acclaim, my reaction remains mixed. It has the best and the worst of the Pythons and their later work; farce, satire, a willingness to laugh at stereotypes of themselves, and a sometimes uncomfortable habit of punching down. 

Charles Crichton's heritage is also all over it, but sometimes a shouty tone and a needless cruelty  threatens to drown it all when it's not just the right side of shocking. It is immaculately plotted, and everyone is having a lot of fun ‚Ä¶ it's just not aged quite as well as you might like to think.",3.0

The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. John Cleese is sensational in one of his best roles, while Kevin Kline is just as skilled at delivering the comedy and Jamie Lee Curtis is just a treasure.

Four Lions,"Terrorism turned into a parody. Satirical with a rather surprisingly offensive premise, which is absolutely bold, refreshing and admirable.

A small group of self-taught but thoroughly incompetent jihadists from Sheffield decide to wage war on British infidels with the promise of martyrdom when they blow themselves up, ultimately settling on the London Marathon in an ill-conceived plan destined for failure.  The satire is absolutely spot-on throughout, hilarious from start to finish, ruthless in its attack on religious extremism.  One would think the nature of the humor would wear thin after a short time, but Morris actually builds on the absurdity that culminates in suicide bombers running through the streets of London dressed as cartoon characters.  It's absurd, it's stinging, and it's absolutely laugh-out-loud funny.",4.5

After satirising everything from the Egyptians to Peregrine Worsthorne in the 90's, with utterly brilliant T.V shows like Brass Eye, The Day Today or Jam, radio shows like On the Hour (birthplace of Alan Partridge), and more recent, ahead of its time madness like Nathan Barley, Morris turned his trade to film in 2010 with the very sobering Four Lions. Based on many true stories about terrorist plots gone wrong, the film follows a terrorist cell of inept individuals, and although very amusing in parts, Morris brings a real human element, in a very cleverly written film. Four Lions is often listed under 'comedies' which really sells the film, and Morris efforts, short, because it is so much more than that.",4.0

Four Weddings and a Funeral,"An all-time favorite for me.  Outstanding film in every way.  Where do I start?  The screenplay is exquisite.  Richard Curtis is my most favorite flick writer and this one could not be better.  Director Mike Newell pairs with Curtis as they seem to understand life.  Like a painting brushed by the best, a movie that has no misplaced words.  Many significant scenes in this one are totally based on the dialogue, you care less about where the setting is.  Mike Newell does a masterful job in setting up his camera to allow the actors to look great in the set pieces.  Michael Coulter, a top line British cinematographer, has made a very ""British"" looking film, beautiful in every way.  Andie McDowell some say cannot act. Bull shit. She is wonderful here with Hugh Grant, and their scenes together are some of the best work by each in their career.  John Hannah and others are top-notch in their supporting roles.  I loved this movie from the first time and always come back every few years to get my perspective with regard to love, marriage, choices, and death.",5.0

Four Weddings and a Funeral,"Endearing and captivating in a way few rom-coms can compare.

Director Mike Newell's British romantic comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Newell's approach to romance is tender and patient as love should feel kind and sympathetic towards people looking for love over the years. Newell shows unrequited love and hurt feelings alongside lost love, renewed affection, and sudden romantic encounters that can be more meaningful than their first appearances. I find Newell's intimate direction so sincere and cunning that every scene feels important and touching. I was either sympathetic for all the missed opportunities or empathetic over the failed relationships or unspoken words of affection. Four Weddings and a Funeral had me teary eyed the entire time.

Writer Richard Curtis delivers one of cinema's most clever and stunningly moving screenplays besides one of the funniest and wittiest comedic scripts. Curtis based Four Weddings and a Funeral on his own numerous wedding experiences, so there is a realism here to all the different romantic dynamics. I feel like Curtis intimately understands what it feels like to love someone from afar, fail out of love, lose someone you love, or fall in love with someone you deeply care for in your heart. Curtis' jokes are hilarious and Four Weddings and a Funeral had me bursting with laughter constantly, but it's his romantic ideas that stayed with me the most. 

I love that Richard Curtis makes the suggestion that we do not often just meet our one true love by chance, but have to go out and find someone to care about, open up to them, listen to their feelings, and work at a loving relationship over time, instead of love at first sight's idyllic simplicity. There's a maturity and wisdom to Curtis' thoughtful writing that I appreciate. He gets that not everyone falls in love immediately and gets married, but often single men and women date and break up, then years later can find someone that they truly feel affection for and want to be with for the rest of their lives. It gives me a refreshing look at romance like Curtis wants the audience to be brave and put yourself out there and to keep an open mind to matters of the heart.

Hugh Grant is lovable as the aloof slacker romantic hero Charles. He's such a clueless fool, who cannot realize when women around him are in love with him, while he stupidly fawns after an unavailable woman. Grant plays the amiable and forlorn romantic hero well as he can be a nimrod, but he's always earnest and likable. Grant's charm and easy going personality work wonders to ensure that Charles always seems like he's worth falling in love with still, no matter how many mistakes he makes. I actually found his purposefully awkward stuttering over lines very endearing.

Grant makes Four Weddings and a Funeral an inspiring story to keep trying for true love, no matter how often you've failed as you are not hopeless. Even as a shy guy myself, I think that Hugh Grant proves that it's better to be brave, talk to girls, get to know them, and ask them out rather than toil away in misery and isolation forever. It does not matter how socially awkward dating can feel as it can be fun too. You should find the words to say to someone you care about if they are said in earnest. His sincerity and natural performance feel very genuine like he's a fairly regular guy. Hugh Grant is hilarious, handsome, and touching in Four Weddings and a Funeral.

Andie MacDowell is fascinating as Carrie, who clearly likes Charles, but she leads him on in various emotionally manipulative ways over the years. She's easy to hate and have affection for and MacDowell tows the line between endearing charm and shocking callousness in her blunt emotional usage of Charles for his affections. Andie MacDowell is a complex romantic heroine as she's a beautiful and lovable woman, but also problematic in how she's also feeding off Charles' puppy dog eyes and shy declarations of love.

James Fleet as the optimistic and seemingly hopeless romantic. Simon Callow is lively and hilarious as Gareth. He was the life of the party and a world of hope and romance leaves with him and his steadfast and jovial friendship. John Hannah is funny and charming, but mostly moving as the sympathetic gay friend Matthew. I found his eulogy endlessly powerful and helpful in prioritizing romance in life. David Bower is sincere and funny as Charles' likable deaf brother David, especially in his key wedding revelation scene towards the end.

Kristin Scott Thomas is melancholic and empathetic as the forlorn Fiona. I loved her gorgeous Goth that clearly loves Charles with all her heart, despite him only seeing her as a friend. She's very sympathetic as how can you not feel for her unrequited love? I think Kristin Scott Thomas is even sexier, more caring, and deeply moving as Fiona in Four Weddings and a Funeral than Andie MacDowell, that Charles probably should have ended up with her instead, honestly. What an incredible supporting actress role from Kristin Scott Thomas. It may be my new favorite performance from her. She's lovely, funny, snarky, and devastating in an emotionally raw and realistic display of acting that few actresses could really touch.

Charlotte Coleman is hysterical as the bubbly redhead punk Scarlett. She's a good friend and adorably playful as Scarlett. I've always thought she steals all of her scenes in Four Weddings and a Funeral. She feels so much like real girls I've known. Rowan Atkinson is a blast as the nervous priest in training Father Gerald. Corin Redgrave is so dismissive as Hamish Banks that he's easy to envy and loathe. Anna Chancellor is divinely pretty and very endearing with her sensitive Henrietta. You feel the worst for her by the end as she doesn't deserve what happens to her, but also it's best that she did not end up with a man who did not truly love her, for what that's worth.

Jon Gregory's editing makes scenes fly by quickly, while always giving the sincere moments time to shine. Michael Coulter delivers striking wide shots, but he knows that all the emotional epiphanies need to be breathtaking close-ups and intimate medium shots. Four Weddings and a Funeral look superb all these decades later. Maggie Gray's production design creates realistic and cozy sets for these characters to wander and flirt in without ever distracting the viewer from these relationships. Anna Pinnock's set decorations are all cute and believable for the charming quaintness of the modest homes to the lavish extravagance of the wealthier abodes.

Composer Richard Rodney Bennett adheres to a touching and playful score that dwells in deep emotions. I love the gentle and nurturing score for Four Weddings and a Funeral. Sue Baker and Gerry Bates' sound design beautifully captures rooms full of wedding guests conversing without the voices blaring over one another. I love how clear and crisp all the voice tracks sound.

In all, Four Weddings and a Funeral blasts by in a fast 117 minutes that you'll wish would never end as you have to eventually say goodbye to all these lovely characters. Four Weddings and a Funeral is an exquisite romantic comedy-drama, showing off what the genre can feel like at its finest.",5.0

The premise for the film is a bit outlandish but it was a risk worth taking as far as the writing of the story went. I largely enjoyed myself and would watch it again!",3.5

Galaxy Quest,"Der Schauspieler Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) verk√∂rpert in der Science Fiction Serie Galaxy Quest den Commander Peter Quincy Taggart. Er und seine Schauspielkollegen, gespielt von: Alan Rickman,Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell und Daryl Mitchell finden heraus, dass die Serie keine Fiktion ist und m√ºssen einer au√üerirdischen Spezies das Leben retten.

Der Film macht sich √ºber das Science Fiction Genre und deren Fans lustig. Tim Allen spielt einen arroganten Schauspieler, welcher seine Rolle nicht verlassen m√∂chte und seine Kollegen nur zum Mittel f√ºr den Zweck sieht. Sigourney Weaver spielt innerhalb der Serie, eine blonde Frau, welche nur sch√∂n auszieht und gro√üe Br√ºste hat. Tony Shalhoub spielt in der Serie einen sch√ºchternen Mann, welcher kaum redet, aber starkes technisches Verst√§ndnis hat. Sam Rockwell spielt in der Serie den Charakter ohne Namen, welcher nur in einer Folge war und dort stirbt. Daryl Mitchell spielt den jungen Mann, welcher in der Serie noch ein Kind war und mittlerweile Erwachsen geworden ist. Und zu guter Letzt kommt Alan Rickman, der ein Au√üerirdischer innerhalb der Serie ist, aber der Schauspieler hasst diese Rolle und will wieder zum ernsten Fach wechseln.

Galaxy Quest macht sich √ºber alle Klischees lustig und nutzt diese perfekt. Sigourney Weaver, wird innerhalb des Films immer freiz√ºgiger und verliebt sich am Ende in den Hauptdarsteller. Oder Alan Rickman m√∂chte ernst genommen werden und weigert sich seine Rolle zu wiederholen, aber am Ende nimmt er sie doch wieder an. Das Gleiche gilt f√ºr die anderen Rollen ebenso und dies funktioniert auch. Die Chemie zwischen den Schauspielern ist super und es gibt viele lustige Momente. Die Effekte sind an einigen Stellen nicht gut gealtert z.b. das Steinmonster, die Kost√ºme der Aliens wiederum sehen heute immer noch gut aus. Im Film gibt es nicht viel Neues, was man noch nicht schon gesehen hat, trotzdem ist er sehr unterhaltend. Es h√§tten noch mehr Charaktere im Film gut gepasst wie ein Kinderdarsteller, welcher jetzt Drogenabh√§ngig geworden ist. Oder Tim Allen h√§tte die Spr√ºche aus der Serie √∂fters wiederholen k√∂nnen. Galaxy Quest h√§tte ruhig ein paar Minuten l√§nger gehen k√∂nnen und mehr Gags w√§ren sch√∂n gewesen.

Galaxy Quest,"With an excellent cast including fantastic turns by Rickman, Allen and Shalhoub and effects that hold up very well, it is a consistently funny parody of/ homage to sci-fi series like ""Star Trek"" and nerdy fandom that in the end somehow manages to be touching too. The writing is on point as it satirizes the bad while affectionately celebrating the good, and rarely puts a foot wrong because, despite having a slightly overlong, occasionally cliched finale, it doesn't overplay any of its elements.",3.5

Game Night,This is a fun movie full of action and surprises.,4.0
Game Night,"It's fine. The kind of movie that makes you chuckle to yourself, silently, maybe even internally. A lot of the jokes are stale and leave you wondering why they even bothered to write them in the first place. The cast is alright, but Bateman can be too predictably‚Ä¶Bateman. If you've seen him in any role, you can pretty much act out the movie along with him. I suppose that's not entirely bad - he is a very talented comedic actor, at the end of the day. Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Sharon Horgan, and Jesse Plemons are all standouts in the cast.

The score is phenomenal. I love the establishing shots that make everything look like miniature models or pieces on a board game. Unfortunately I just wasn't laughing as much as I should've been, nor was I as thrilled as I should've been.",3.0

That one friend is actually a criminal who sells things on the black market, and he got into shady business so he was wanted by the bad guys. They run around and try to fix everything (they can't turn their friend in because the cops might have holes in their force and try to kill him).

The General,"Buster Keaton's movies have always been viewed in the same league as those of Charlie Chaplin, but the man himself has made less impression. Chaplin knew how to exaggerate his physical traits to draw attention to himself. Even his physical appearance is more distinct ‚Äì the tramp's outfit and the comic moustache.

By contrast, Keaton was more impassive. He avoided pulling faces, and his reactions to events were more understated. He was a small man with a grave face. In The General, he sports long, curly hair. Keaton did not portray his characters as figures of fun. They were not absurd in themselves, even though absurd things happened to them.

Plenty of absurd things happen to Johnnie Gray, the hero of The General (played of course by Keaton). He engages in pratfalls, and tools are not his friend. If he is cutting wood, he will lose his axe head. If he is brandishing a sword, the blade will fall off. In an early scene, he is followed to the house of his sweetheart by a couple of children, whom he fails to notice them until they get inside the house.

This humour was necessary in silent comedy where there was a greater emphasis on slapstick drollery, since this was the most visual expression of a joke. Nonetheless what marks the Keaton hero is not foolishness, but an astonishing amount of resourcefulness and inventiveness.

The General is about the two loves of Johnnie Gray's life, and the lengths that he goes through to rescue them. The first is his fianc√©e Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), and the second is The General. The General is a large locomotive, and Johnnie is the engineer who drives the train. When he goes to visit Annabelle, he gives her a photograph of himself and The General. This seems rather apt, given his close affection for both loves are tied together.

His life is changed by the outbreak of the American Civil War. Annabelle's family are instantly keen to sign up and fight for the Confederates. As a comic character, Johnnie is less enthusiastic, but he is anxious to please Annabelle so he ensures that he is first in the line to enlist.

Unfortunately the recruiters reject his application because they decide that he would be more use to them as a train engineer. They do not explain the reason to Johnnie, leading to a comic scene as the little man compares himself to other men who were accepted, and who are neither taller nor muscular than he, and he makes several more failed attempts to sneakily join up. ""If you lose the war, don't blame me!"" the exasperated engineer proclaims.

Johnnie is unable to explain how he was rejected by the army, so his fianc√©e's family think that he is a shirker, and regard him as a disgrace to the South. Annabelle tells him that she will refuse to speak to him until he is in uniform.

This changes when Unionist soldiers steal The General, and accidentally abduct Annabelle too. What follows is a great chase in which Johnnie single-handedly pursues the runaway train, overcoming a number of obstacles that the soldiers put in his way. After he rescues both train and lover, the action takes place in reverse with the Unionist soldiers pursuing The General, and Johnnie seeking to obstruct their path.

The Keaton hero is not a loser like the Chaplin hero. He is not a vagrant, but a worker. He is not an unusual man, but an ordinary one. As armies advance and retreat, we see the solitary figure of Johnnie chopping wood, oblivious to what is going on around him. Wars may come and go, but figures such as Johnnie will still be around when the rifles are put away.

Nonetheless an ordinary man can be heroic too. This is not a movie that makes any point concerning the nature of war, either for or against fighting. It takes the side of the Confederates by way of plot convenience, but does not seek to promote the values that Confederates stood for. It is merely a celebration of individual courage and ingenuity.

There was an audacity in Keaton's thinking too. A fan of train history, Keaton was inspired by the Great Locomotive Chase, a true event that happened during the American Civil War. Keaton studied photographs taken during the Civil War, and tried to recreate the look for the movie.  He also bought the trains used in the film, and purchased a wide range of Civil War paraphernalia.

With a cast of 3,000 paid people and a running cost of $400 an hour, The General proved, alas, to be the undoing of Buster Keaton. The film studio was unhappy with the cost of the film, and their anxiety was not helped when the making of the movie led to a few accidents and forest fires. The movie was made on a large budget, but it failed to make a significant profit. This was Keaton's greatest financial failure, and he lost his independence as a moviemaker as a result.

Nonetheless many years later Keaton said that he was prouder of The General than of any other film that he had made. Time has proven him right. The General is now regarded with high esteem, and is thought to be one of the best silent movies ever made. I can only agree. The movie is better than I can describe, because its brilliance can only be appreciated when you see it.

I wrote a blog expressing a longer appreciation of the film if you would like to read more: https://themoviescreenscene.wordpress.com/2018/03/18/the-general-1926/",5.0
The General,"The General was a okay movie. It was very hard to understand, but this film was made in the 1920's, so I'll cut it slack. From what I understand of it, The General was a interesting movie. Also surprisingly, The General was a really funny movie, and guess what? I LOVE comedy! The General is very overrated though. People say it's a masterpiece, but for me it's not. I don't understand what's so good about this movie, speaking of understand I could barely understand  the movie. I give this a 70%.",4.0
The General,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME, ITS NOSTALGIC CLASSIC ORIGINAL AMZING UMAI, ITS BETTER THEN THE GODFATHER",5.0
The General,"Buster Keaton defies death by jumping around train cabooses.

Directors Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman's silent war action-comedy The General (1926) is still hysterical! It's amazing how a silent film that is nearly a century old can still be funny. Keaton's creative direction looks incredible and finds all sorts of fun angles and tricks to show off his death defying stunts. Keaton gets in front of trains, runs across tracks, jumps from cabin to cabin, shoots cannons, and any number of other deadly stunts. If he had made even one mistake, Keaton could have easily died during the making of The General.

It's a delightful romantic comedy, Civil War spoof, and thrilling action-comedy to thrill viewers of all ages and affiliations with hilarious physical comedy. Buster Keaton's brilliant slapstick is as endearing, creative, skillful, and absurdly funny as Charlie Chaplin or Harry Lloyd. The General proves he was a master of his craft and was not afraid to be daring. Writers Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman piece together cute lines about a young Southern conductor wanting to enlist in the army to impress his girl only to have to rescue her when Northern spies steal his locomotive and lady on board. 

Buster Keaton moves with a brisk sprint, fast dives, silly falls, a blank expression, and an endless amount of courage. He's likable as the foolish train conductor hero. His love of his train and his girl come across with Mr. Bean level slapstick encounters that lead to all sorts of carnage. Marion Mack is pretty as the damsel in distress Annabelle and eventual helper to Keaton's hero.

Editors Buster Keaton and Sherman Kell cut around all sorts of danger to show off Buster's physical comedy prowess. I loved Buster looking through a burnt peephole to see his love in distress. Cinematographers Bert Haines and Devereaux Jennings get super creative in ultra wide shots of the trains, bridges, and switches or when they use cute close-ups on Buster to make his emotions clearer. Fred Gabourie's neat antique art direction looks like old Civil War era photos. Harry Roselotte's realistic sets alongside Buster Keaton and Earl Mohan's stunts are something to behold. Fred Carlton Ryle's dark eye makeup for Buster and lovely hair for Marion Mack is pretty.

In short, The General is a quick 79 minutes long full of laughs and innovative for a timeless comedy.",5.0
The General,I'd definitely recommend this film to fans of slapstick comedy and silent films. I'm not sure I've seen Buster Keaton in film before but this was certainly very entertaining and a good watch. I can't say I followed every single detail but there was enough to keep me amused and the text shown on screen helped to explain some things.,4.0
The General,"The General is an impressive feat of silent cinema. Buster Keaton really swung for the fences on this film, and it shows. From the sets to the stunts to the humor, The General captivates its audience as it brings them along for the amusing ride. It does feel a little strange to root for the Confederate army during this movie, but there's no denying that The General is generally a well-made film.",4.0
The General,"Inspired by the Great Locomotive Chase, a true event that occurred during the American Civil War, this is one of Buster Keaton's funniest films from the silent era. Rejected by the Confederate Army, train engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton) must rescue his beloved locomotive when it is seized by Union spies.

People tell Annabell he's a coward and she won't speak to him until he's in uniform.  A year later, Union spies have captured the General and kidnapped annabell intent on recking havoc on the South.  Johnnie comes to the rescue.",4.5

The General,"I'm not a Buster Keaton fan, but one has to admit that the direction and cinematography in this hundred year old silent feature are exemplary, far ahead of anything produced at the time. I watched this in the cleaned up, colourised version, with expertly placed sound effects. It was as if David Lean had been at the helm (not least when the steam train crashes off the wooden bridge into the river below). Keaton is physically adept and almost entirely unfunny. The acting generally is surprisingly naturalistic.",3.0
The General,"""The General"" is a picture that tells a tall tale in a way that only Keaton can do. It's his magnum opus, that proves his mastery of his craft on all levels from the focused story, to the magnetic performances and set pieces, to the glorious music and amazing direction from co-directors, (Keaton and Bruckman). This a timeless classic of a sprawling epic tale that elevates, innovates the medium. Whilst showing off the talent of an amazing artist.",4.0

Considering that the main character would have owned or would have been working towards owning a slave and that the leading woman's character probably did own slaves, this movie is just about as entertaining as a feel-good comedy about a Nazi fighting the English. 

It doesn't help that Buster Keaton is no Charlie Chaplin. While the action is fairly consistent, the comedy is not. It's a hint of slapstick thrown in every now and again, hardly something to guffaw at.",1.0
The General,"This is remarkably impressive work. Keaton's ability to visualize scenes of great complexity and realism and then get them to physically manifest before the camera while simultaneously acting and giving some of the most impressive physical performances ever must be appreciated by true fans of cinema; or art in general, really.
I wasn't sure how I would take this film at first. It can be a real stretch to relate to and really appreciate films from this long ago in a way comparable to how they were for their time and that generation. Yeah, a lot of the prat falls verge on the corny, or do cross that line. But then there's the startling ease with which Keaton moves about the train; pulling himself back onto it, jumping or falling off, walking along the edge as it barrels along. 
The scene of the train crashing into the river as the bridge collapses has to be among the most impressive effects/scenes of its time. 
I found this often funny, from the physical humor to the saluting scene at the very end. That scene's very specific type of visual humor has been copied and used to great effect by comedy acts, writers, directors actors from Chaplin to The Three Stooges to Allen in the 70's. 3.8 stars",4.0
The General,"The General was a film way ahead of its time. Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance  as the film's protagonist as he is charismatic and often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs. With the film being related to trains, the film has numerous train related jokes that are very appropriate for this film that can be very hysterical.  It should be noted that Buster Keaton was a talented man. Good actor, writer, director, and even a stuntman. He did his own stunts in The General that are not only impressive but excellent as well. His stunts were special and effective. The General is one of the funniest, artistic, and greatest films ever made.",5.0

Director Malcolm D. Lee's comedy Girls Trip (2017) is exactly what you think it'll be and it's a blast. Four best friends have grown distant and bored, so they take a flight to New Orleans for sex, alcohol, and a rekindled friendship. Lee's direction lets the ladies' performance take the forefront and provide all the funny moments. Writers Erica Rivinoja, Tracy Oliver, and Kenya Barris create a simple story of female friendship, forgiveness, dependence, honesty, maturity, and moving on from bad relationships. Girls Trip has the most shocking and outrageous jokes, I was aghast by the grapefruit joke, but can also be tenderly sincere. I loved Girls Trip.

Editor Paul Millspaugh generally cuts very slickly around scenes, but it can get confusing or awkwardly cut in all the comedy chaos. Girls Trip does not feel like 122 minutes with its ultra fast pace. Cinematographer Greg Gardiner has a cute medium and close-up shooting style. I didn't care for the ugly digital look of Girls Trip, but the camera work is pretty creative for a contemporary comedy. Production designer Keith Brian Burns creates sleek modern bar and festival sets for the Essence Fest and utilizes New Orleans' party city vibes. Composer David Newman brings lively music for Girls Trip, but the soundtrack from the live performances is particularly fun.

Regina Hall is drop dead gorgeous, hilarious, and heartfelt in her lead actress role as bestselling author and television hostess Ryan Pierce. I adore Regina Hall for her effortlessly funny delivery and bubbly personality. She's so sweet and lovable with her signature lively and earnest acting. I love that Girls Trip is a lead actress part for Hall. She's a scream in Girls Trip with a surprisingly touching sense of drama as well.

Queen Latifah is very sincere and fun as the gossip tabloid journalist Sasha Franklin. She's a riot and comes across as a natural comedic force. Jada Pinkett Smith lets loose as the nurse and mother Lisa Miller Cooper. I'm glad she could be playful and absurd like the other ladies in a pleasantly energetic performance. Jada looks beautiful and is quite funny. Tiffany Haddish steals the movie as her filthy mouthed, loud, and loyal friend Dina. She's truly unhinged and hilarious with no filter at all. She's very pretty and likable. What a delightful leading cast of fantastic actresses.

Larenz Tate is nice and supportive as Ne-Yo's bassist Julian. He has a considerate rapport and natural chemistry with Regina Hall's Ryan. Mike Colter is surprisingly sleazy and underhanded as the selfish cheater Steward Pierce. Kate Walsh is really leaning into the cringe inducing comedy as awkward agent Elizabeth Davelli. Kofi Siriboe is funny as the handsome young man Malik, who Jada likes. Deborah Ayorinde is sexy as Stewart's mistress Simone. Lara Grice pulls off an astonished face as the advertiser Bethany. Mike Epps' snake oil salesman, who sells Tiffany absinthe feels very New Orleans, if you've ever been. I liked the cameos from P. Diddy, Common, De-Yo, Mariah Carey, Faith Evans, MC Lyte, Estelle, Mase, and Ava DuVernay.

In all, Girls Trip is a raunchy riot with ridiculously lurid sex jokes and endearing characters brought to life by a lovable cast of actresses.",4.0
Girls Trip,"How can you not watch a movie that was nominated for Best Ensemble at the AARP's Movies for Grownups Awards? 

While Girls Trip does move in a new direction for representation and has a fun main cast, it's still mostly a twist on the Hangover/Grown Ups formula. In fact, it's like Grown Ups in more ways than one, because both have humor based around peeing where you're not supposed to; not one but two characters manage to piss over pssarsby on Bourbon Street. It makes it's way over into gross-out humor more often than you'd expect, but the chemistry of the main group is undeniable and the script doesn't forget about its themes of close friendship even though most of the supporting characters are either forgettable or caricatures that will likely age poorly. Still, you can say that the ability of the film to surprise audiences alone is make it worth your while, and the story is well-structured overall - good character development, nice payoffs to most of the arcs, pretty sincere affection compared to most buddy flicks of the past few years, and Tiffany Haddish bumping up the voltage on her taser before handing it off to her friend.

"Good Morning, Vietnam","This is Robin Williams movie. A vechile to showcase his talents.
Aside from that, the story skims over some complex yet important issues, which is disappointing.",3.5
"Good Morning, Vietnam","Another exceptional movie for Robin Williams and one of his top 5 best movies for sure!  Forest Whitaker was so great in this too and his supporting acting was very key to this movie's nice success.  Especially the bike chase scene as it is so funny riding that bike with zero wheels and just on the rims!  Plus the bike is much too small for his good size.  Such a good actor he is in so many roles over the years.    

It made me sad watching this again today finally after so many yrs gone by as it is hard knowing how good Williams was and then came his suicide death many yrs ago.  He is thoroughly missed!  

Not sure if you can call this a war movie or to call it a regular drama movie set during war times but it clearly is war themed!

To the odd very few people who have yet to see this...what is the wait?!  This is exceptionally directed and they just do not make nearly as many movies to this grand caliber anymore!  9 out of 10!  (All DAY LONG!)

"Good Morning, Vietnam","Much of the humor in this film hasn't aged very well (a lot of it is referential, and the 'style' of humor didn't really connect with me), but it's still worth watching for being one of the only Vietnam war movies that doesn't just give a token shot at humanizing the Vietnamese but actually spends some time on it. That, and of course the amazing performance by Robin Williams.",2.5

"Good Morning, Vietnam","In this movie Levinson with his non-binding direction offers to Robin Williams the perfect stage to unleash his irreverent, rapid-fire comedy. And this is not to the detriment of a proper plot development, as the relationships between the characters change remarkably during the movie. Laughs are guaranteed, but sometimes they are bitter...it's Vietnam after all. Yet it remains an unambitious movie.",4.0
"Good Morning, Vietnam","Arguably the best performance from Robin Williams, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" serves as an over-the-top maniac comedy that has a surprisingly moving story. The present action is usually more shocking and unexpected when compared to other war movies, though it is done very well. The comedy is top-notch and is sure to get quite a few laughs thanks to the stellar performance of its star Robin Williams.",4.5
"Good Morning, Vietnam","This movie is based on the true story of an US Air Force man transferred from Crete to Vietnam in 1965 to be the new DJ of the US Army radio station, and when he goes on the air for the first time, he refuses to follow the dull format of the previous DJ or play the dull music that had been played. In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.

A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clich√©d, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?

I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier.",1.0

The Graduate,"Some say it is a classic film, a comedy yet why would Elaine want to be with Ben!? This film does not make sense. There is no reason for their relationship to work. A love conquers all sure but they could both find other people in time. Does not hold up and not sure it ever did.",1.5
The Graduate,"Something that I noticed in the first scene form Ben's room is that he is kinda lonely and has to do whatever his parents tell him to do something that stands out to me about what Nichol's did for the opening 
of the film and his characterization of Ben, is that doesn't get to do what he wants. That's why he doesn't 
like his parents a lot is because his parents have him do what they want him to do and not what he wants",2.5
The Graduate,"Mrs. Robinson Asks Benjamin to drive her home. Mrs. Robinson, then proceeds to make Benjamin come wait inside while Mr. Robinson gets home. Mrs. Robinson offers Benjamin a drink, but Benjamin rejects a drink, Mrs. Robinson starts to act flirty and gives Benjamin a drink. Mrs. Robinson goes upstairs and tells Benjamin to come up. Benjamin says no I have to go now this is really weird, Mrs. Robinson starts saying some freaky things to Benjamin and he feels uncomfortable and wants to go home all the sudden Mrs. Roberts, and go to the bathroom and ask Benjamin to come upstairs and give her her purse. When Benjamin comes upstairs to the room to get the purse, Mrs. Robinson comes in naked and chest door, and then Benjamin runs out and goes downstairs.",4.5
The Graduate,Something that stood out to me in The graduate is how formal they talked back then and now in modern society we use a lot more slang or a lot relax talking mannerisms it shows how much respect has fallen from then and another thing is the main character was very quick to marry someone that he had only gon out with once from what I seen,3.0
The Graduate,"One visual motif that often recurs in The Graduate is the use of water. I believe that the director often shows water surrounding Ben in order to show how he feels as if he is drowning from all of the pressure and stress in his life. An example of this would be in the beginning of the movie, when there is a close up scene of Ben sitting in front of his fish tank. Another example would be later in the film when Ben dives underwater to avoid hearing his parents speak about where he spends his afternoons. In both of these cases, Ben is under a lot of pressure and emotionally feels as if he is sinking, showing how the use of water is symbolic.",4.0
The Graduate,"I think the ending of the movie was a good closing. Nichols depicts Ben as finding the one thing he had been looking for throughout the movie. Ben found a sense of direction and a goal after college through Elaine. Although it isn't necessarily a happy ending, to Ben it's a fresh start and a new opportunity with Elaine. They also understand the severity of the situation, as they drive away in the bus, and have a moment looking at each other after they both leave their old lives.",3.5
The Graduate,In the first scene the director tries to make Ben seem very lonesome and having many problems within his mind and making different scenarios in his head of the future and when he goes downstairs to meet his family the camera work is very close up and unstable making the audience feel what Ben feels which is very anxious and closed in he's being pulled around being asked questions he has no answer to very chaotic.,4.0
The Graduate,"""The Graduate"" is a really cool movie from a long time ago, like in the 1960s. It's about a guy named Benjamin who just finished college, but he's kind of lost and doesn't know what to do with his life. Then he meets Mrs. Robinson, who is older and kind of mysterious, and they start a complicated relationship. The movie has great music, and it's all about growing up and figuring out who you are. It's a classic that people still watch today because it's funny and has a cool ending.",4.0
The Graduate,In the scene where Ben is trying to leave the Robinson house where he is trying to leave the purse in a open area Mrs Robinson  keeping telling Ben to hand it to her but eventually he just sets in on the bed and Mrs Robinson slides in and I think they wanted to make Ben a insistent person√© because he continues to leave the house and the situation,3.0
The Graduate,"In The Graduate, I found it interesting how they filmed Ben in most shots. Frequently, Ben was shadowed by something such as his parents, Ms.Robinson, the car, etc. I think this is supposed to represent the way Ben has always lived. He's always been overshadowed by people like his parents and Ms. Robinson. It's a super interesting way to represent/depict Ben.",4.5
The Graduate,"I really enjoyed this film, it's revolutionary for its time. In the final moments of this film, the weight of Ben's decision is seen in the way he seems to be pondering his decision. He is seen as happy in the heat of the moment, but slowly his face falls, as if the weight of this decision is catching up with him. This ending is slightly happy, Ben gets what he wants but he doesn't know if it was worth it. Elaine is likely going to lose her family, and Ben has no car. Ben made a very quick decision to marry Elaine, but does he really want her? Does Ben even know Elaine? He will be with her for likely the rest of his life and he barely knows her.",4.5
The Graduate,"The final shots were kind of awkward, especially the bus scene. I feel like it represents the shock they were both in as they kind of just left everything behind and ran without even thinking. Ben is really changed at the end. At first, he struggled to even speak for himself and express his opinions. Towards the end, he was well spoken and could express what he thought well. I feel like the ending represented it well when he interrupted the wedding instead of watching it happen. I think it's a happy ending but a bit dumb as nothing was really thought out by Elaine or Ben.",3.5
The Graduate,A visual motif that recurs in the film is vertical stripes. The purpose of this motif is to show Ben as being trapped into this life that he doesn't want. Two examples of this is in his room the walls that have painted vertical lines and when his is at the zoo and they show him behind the bars. These vertical strips make him look like he is trapped in a prison that everyone is forcing him into.,2.5
The Graduate,In this film Mike Nichols uses the fish tank and the monkey exhibit to express how he is trapped in his own mind and can't escape. These examples further show how he does not know what he will do with his life and how he is always put under a lot of pressure by adults around him.,4.5
The Graduate,God this movie is awful. Main character is a DUNCE - so unpleasant.,1.0
The Graduate,"Leave it to Mike Nichols to use what is now a cliched ending and still be the only person to recognize that its not all that romantic. One of the few late 60s comedies (maybe the only one) that doesn't feel trapped in that era, probably due to all the inventive stylistic choices and Hoffman's entirely unconventional performance.",5.0
The Graduate,"Yk what's the sole purpose of any movie is that it should entertain u throughout and the graduate is a wholesome entertainer,it's not just excels in entertainment but other factors too,the acting of Dustin Hoffman feels so raw and effortless,the screenplay is very gripping and the music is superb.....This is a movie of 1967 but it didn't feel like an outdated one it's just so fun and has a high repeat value.",4.5
The Graduate,"One of 1967's best movies.
For a movie the is about consequences, it doesn't take it's self to seriously with a shar & witty screenplay.
And the soundtrack deserves kudos as well.",4.5
The Graduate,"Watched again in April 2023.   Dustin Hoffmann plays a stalker. Katherine Ross plays a co-dependent frat girl. Yeah, Anne Bancroft plays a love-starved, sex-starved middle age rich housewife. Everybody else just simply talks too much.  I honestly got tired of Dustin Hoffman doing nothing, lots of doing nothing. If I were ""Elaine"", I would have gotten a restraining order.
 
Maybe I liked it in 1967 because everyone raved about it.  I didn't know any better. In 2023 I still probably don't know any better, but I can now say that it is boring and much ado about nothing.    The ending was kinda neat, though.",3.0

The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Not many characters had real impact on a story. It seemed like it was happening to them. Outside of 2 main characters, it was uncommon to even see them having character. To many of them were expected to be carried by coolness factor. First 15-ish minutes of a movie to show us a life of a hotel... Witch was left be characters in 15th minute of a movie and was irrelevant ever since. Those sort of things you can see all over a place in this movie. Characters are dry. Jokes are unfunny.

The Grand Budapest Hotel,Monsieur Gustave is a complicated character the direct characterization shows that he is very civilized and clean and does his best to make everything spiffy like the train scene but the indirect characterization is that he is really like an animal and deep down if he is in certain situations he'll lose his cool and become and entirely different person like he was raised on the and by the streets almost like in the prison scene I love this character,5.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"One of the most significant choices made by director Wes Anderson in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was his attention to design and color choices. Anderson's decision to create a visually distinct aspect for the film, characterized by vibrant colors and detailed sets, was a crucial factor of the movie's success. This choice was significant because it not only served as a visual for the audience but also became an important part of the storytelling. The vivid colors design elements reinforced the film's unique tone, showing viewers in the unique universe of the Grand Budapest Hotel. It exemplifies Anderson's visual style, making it a visually memorable and rich piece of cinematic experience",3.0

After hearing this, Gustave decided to steal it to prevent Dimitri from getting it. This shows how he is determined. When Gustave becomes the main suspect for the murder of Madame. D, he is eventually arrested for fleeing the police in the Grand Budapest. He works with some fellow prisoners to escape the prison, even though they took a long time. This shows his dedication. He also cares for his lobby boy, Zero, preventing anyone from harming him, showing that he is willing to protect those that he cares about.",4.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has some really cool film work and shots. First, the tracking shots were my favorite. At one point there was a chase from a bus all the was to a church and it was all tracking shots. This adds intensity to the chase and makes you feel like you're in it. Next, the symmetry. It's everywhere in the movie and it really is cool to see. No other film uses so much of it.",4.5
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"In The Grand Budapest Hotel, the most important directorial choice that Wes Anderson makes is the choice to tell a story, within a story, within a story. With the different timelines, and the different aspect ratios corresponding with the timelines, it gives a very unique feel to the film. The choice to do this was significant because it makes it easier to understand which part takes place during which time period. It also works well with Wes Anderson's directing style, considering the wackiness that takes place in the main story can be explained by it being told within a story, within a story. Overall, the way the movie was filmed was very unique and equally as entertaining.",4.5
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"I think the most important choice that Wes Anderson made when directing this film is in how he structured the story within another story. That choice shaped how the multiple narrative elements came together. Overall, it created a unique atmosphere within the movie, and the setting and actions of the characters within each narrative helped to set the distinction between narratives.",4.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,This movie is great and in my opinion Wes Andersons best. In this he uses the stories inside each other to represent that that is truly what happens in the realm world and you most likely would never know it. An example in the movie would be in the first sequence that goes through 3 stories to tell another with the girl in reading the book written by another man who tells his story of how Zero tells him his story. It's wild and Wes Anderson controls it so well.,5.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"The grand Budapest hotel was directed by Wes Anderson, and there are several creative choices that he chose in the film. The most significant choice he made was to use different relationships to tell the movies different time periods",5.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,I like how the movie started and ends with the 2 people talking but I extremely like how the director chose to tell a story within the movie and how he occasionally narrated parts of what was going on,4.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,I feel like the most important choice made by Wes Anderson was the frame tales. It added to the experience of the movie and made the story telling much more interesting. It also gave the movie a unique feeling because of how many stories needed closure at the end and how he was able to successfully do it. It was significant because it was a new experience.,3.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,Throughout the movie Anderson uses different frames in the different scenes. Anderson uses different frames from different time periods to tell us the different years that each scene took place. I think he chose to present it this way not only to make sure the audience could follow but to really add depth to the story and show that this wasn't something that just happened one weekend. This added to the movie because it made the story feel more complex and a deeper story.,3.5
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"I loved this movie, Wes Anderson is an amazing director and it really shows in this movie. If you think about the storytelling that's occurring, you realize that Wes is suggesting that stories are illusions that can be used to celebrate someone, or just remember them. Stories help the people who tell them cope with someone's death, by sharing their memory with others and keeping that person alive through storytelling. Zero tells the visitor the whole story of the grand Budapest hotel, in order to keep it alive and spread Gustaves and Agatha's memory. Zero talks about how he bought the hotel to remember his good times with Agatha, not Gustave. When Zero says ""He certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace"" it made me think about how the film is basically all an illusion, looking into the past. When you see the grand Budapest hotel at the beginning, it almost looks fake because we are in the illusion of the past.",5.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,I think the story telling over the story telling was really cool and I did think it was confusing because there was a lot going on at a time and that was just confusing for me but I thought the story telling on top on the story telling was what made it really good,2.5
The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Wes Anderson's use of camera angles in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is nothing short of brilliant. He employs a variety of unique and meticulously planned shots that contribute to the film's distinctive visual style. Anderson often uses symmetrical framing, which creates a sense of order and balance in each scene. the director's choice of camera angles often complements the humor and absurdity of the story. Overall, Wes Anderson's mastery of camera angles in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a testament to his unique filmmaking style, which elevates the storytelling and immerses the audience in a visually captivating world.",5.0
The Grand Budapest Hotel,4. One of the most important director choices that stood out to me was how he always used bright colors in the hotel with their clothes and the bakery and everything. The only time he didn't use these was when the mood changed like whenever Serge was on screen or when he was in prison. I think it was really significant because it changed the mood of the story and made the movie more bright and exciting or more suspenseful and sad at certain times.,5.0
The Great Dictator,By far the best anti-war speech in the history of cinema... truly a great example for many generations.I'm still having a hard time realizing that the movie is out in 1940,5.0
The Great Dictator,"A Political Satire where Charlie Chaplin displays his skill with Talkies
By; John Byrne

The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin, was Chaplin's first production with synced sound. Despite being the first he performed very well in both of his roles as the antisemitic dictator and the Jewish barber. Filled with physical comedy he was known for, that I found shared similarities with The Three Stooges I was laughing at the slapstick comedy as much as the political satire. This film was first released in 1940 just after the start of WWII, but Chaplin like many across the world were aware of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s and the antisemitic rhetoric that he campaigned and grew popular on. This film ridiculed Adolf Hitler, Nazis and antisemitism. In his role as both actor, writer and director Chaplin created a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Watching it today in 2023 I drew many similarities to our American election in 2016 and 2020 and the presidency of Donald Trump as well as the rise in nationalist politicians across the world. The film was relevant at the time not only because WWII had just started but because America had not yet entered the war.
Having watched Napoleon Dynamite recently I found similarities in the use of comedy to deliver a powerful message. Napoleon Dynamite attended a school where some groups of kids made fun of and bullied other students, Napoleon among the students that were bullied. Some of these students would use derogatory terms when talking about Napoleons new friend, a new student and of Mexican descent. Napoleon's home life wasn't much better, he lived with a mother that would leave for a week or more an older brother that bullied him and an uncle that also bullied him. In this film we see it resolve by Napoleon conquering some of his own anxieties and playing tetherball with the girl he likes. In The Great Dictator the movie ends with the Jewish Barber assume the role of dictator in a comedic twist of events. Both movies known for their use of one liners and social impact at the time of release. 
I would recommend this movie to everyone, going into the movie I had few expectations, but I knew I Charlie Chaplin was a legend to come out of the silent film era. I was pleased to hear dialogue between the characters and the film was comedic enough to keep me entertained throughout. Despite being about such a serious topic the movie was overall still very funny.",3.5
The Great Dictator,"""‚Ä¶ it'll carry weight"" ""You mean I will carry weight HAHAHA.""
	
In 2023 making jokes about any subject matter that is painful for anyone is widely considered offensive. But I grew up in the 1990s so that type of stuff doesn't bother me. I am a former standup comedian and a current fan of all things comedy‚Ä¶ with that said this movie was an absolute masterpiece. I can understand how some people might watch this movie and be offended‚Ä¶ and to those people I say ""why is your life so sad? Get it together you bum.""
""The Great Dictator"" written, directed, starring, and produced by the great Charlie Chaplin is the story of a Jewish Barber who suffered amnesia at the end of World War I, returning home a fictional country (Tomainia) who was on the losing end of that war. It takes place roughly 20 years after the end of the war and because of the barber's traumatic brain injury he does not know how much time has passed thinking he has only been away from his beloved Barber shop for only a couple of weeks. I have always heard about this movie but never made the time to see it because I normally find old comedies to be very of the time, and I don't generally find that entertaining. The great dictator was released in 1940 so it sat in the category of movies I would actively avoid. But I did know a general background of the movie‚Ä¶ it's supposed to lampoon Adolf Hitler and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany before World War II (electric boogaloo). I had very low expectations for how funny I would find this movie, and the one thing that stood out to me in the first 25 minutes were the similarities to movies written and directed by Mel Brooks such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs. Spaceballs was a very silly movie with no real message attached to it, blazing saddles on the other hand is very much in the same vein as the great dictator where it tackles a very painful very dark depressing social issue in racism. The great dictator tackles anti-Semitism head on showing just how terrible the lives of the Jews in the ghetto work but masterfully weaves in humor not to dull the message but in an effort to make the viewing experience more enjoyable. Charlie Chaplin is unquestionably the biggest star of the silent movie era and that's evident throughout this movie there are certain scenes where chaplain leans heavily on physical comedy that you might see in a silent movie but on the other side of the coin, he also uses very effective joke delivery verbally. Near the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the Barber gets into a fight with a pair of the stormtroopers (the movies depiction fo the SS). During the scuffle he ends up getting hit on the head and does a very silent movie era over sell of being hit where he stumbles up and down the street going on and off the curb which I found very funny. But again it's not just silent movie error humor that he uses, for example the title of this review... Chaplain who also played the dictator Hynkel is speaking to Garbitsch (pronounced garbage) and he suggests that high goal dance with the wife of a neighboring dictator to help insert dominance over him, telling him that ""it will carry weight"". Knowing this woman they are speaking about is an overweight lady Hynkel's response of ""You mean I will carry weight"" is absolute gold. 
The social impact of this movie can't be understated. As stated, the great dictator was released in 1940, which was before the United states even entered World War II. Meaning that the knowledge of the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis in Germany was widespread. The courage it took for Charlie Chaplin to take such a thinly veiled shot at such a powerful dictator is something that should be admired. But at the same time the ability to make that shot powerful as well as entertaining was absolutely amazing.
I give this movie 9 fat dictator wives out of 10.",4.5
The Great Dictator,"The Great Dictator was released in 1940. It was written and directed by the great Charles Chaplin himself. He also starred in the movie alongside Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie. The movie was satire and it made fun of the Nazis and Hitler. It was about a dictator who wanted to kill all the Jews and dominate the world only to be mistaken for a barber and have that same barber, who escaped a concentration camp, replace him and end the war and the misery that he had caused. The great performance of Charlie Chaplin is one of the biggest reasons why the movie was successful.  
I watched this movie for the first time today and I have never heard of it before this week. I was not expecting much from it when I started watching the movie. I know about Chaplin as everyone else. My expectation was that this movie would be a silent film where Chaplin does all those same stunts and acts funny. When I watched the actual movie, I realized that this was critique of the mindset of dictators like Hitler and it made all the ideas and the uniforms as well as everything the Nazis stood for sound very silly.  
Chaplin was up to his old comedy tricks which were funny. But, he also showed great acting and range to go from the funny to the serious and inspiring in the same movie. He was playing two different characters in the movie. One could say that he carried the movie by himself. 
The movie touches on the issue of racism towards Jews and other minorities. This is a similar them to what we see in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. The difference is that the historical contexts are different with The Great Dictator coming in the time of World War II when the Holocaust was going on. 
My recommendation would be to see this movie for sure. I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this to me before now. It is a great movie.",4.0
The Great Dictator,"I am making a post review for my class.

 In the movie the Great Dictator directed by Charlie Chapman who was also one of the main actors as a barber owner who lived in the Ghetto in Germany tries to bring humor during a horrible time in history by going against the storm troopers and the famous Hinkel who was Adolf Hitler who was also played by Charlie Chapman. During that time Hitler was killing and executing Jewish people because of there Ethnic and religious beliefs background as a Jew. Charlie Chapman was able to bring some humor and happiness to the people thru film with the help of some of the following his friend Hannah played by Paulette Goddard she lived next store to the barber shop he worked at and became real close. As well as Schultz played by Reginald Gardner who was saved by Chaplain  by guiding is plane out of harms way against the enemy little did he know they would be come great friends and who also help bring humor to the film. On the side of fence there was some great humor with some actors such as Herring who is played by Bill Gilbert and who was one of Hinkel right hand man
(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)
 There was a scene in the movie thought was funny when he was trying to show Hinkel some stuff he was working on with scientists and they all failed one included a man jumping out the window and he fell which I thought was funny because he was suppose to fly. Thru Charlie film he showed people what was going on in there country and the movie even made it way to the US and was broadcasted and released around 1940 (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032553/releaseinfo/).",4.0
The Great Dictator,"""The Great Dictator"" is one of those films that sneaks up on you. What may be easily passed off as ""just another old movie"" can quickly become one of the most influential films you've ever watched. This cinematic gem was directed, written, and produced by none other than THE legendary Charlie Chaplin. This iconic piece takes a bold leap into the realms of political satire, and even eight decades after its release, it is still a powerful statement against totalitarianism, wrapped in Chaplin's iconic brand of humor. 

The film is set against the bleak backdrop of the 1930s, a period marked by the rise of Adolf Hitler and the looming threat of another great war. Chaplin, in dual roles, plays one Adenoid Hynkel, who is a ruthless dictator who is an obvious portrayal of Hitler, and a Jewish barber who is eventually mistaken for Hynkel. The climax of the mix-up sets the stage for a hilarious but poignant exploration of identity, power, and humanity. 

The film stands out for its bold social justice message. In a time when the world was grappling with the horrors of fascism, Chaplin used his platform to highlight the absurdity and cruelty of totalitarian regimes. I think his portrayal of Hynked as a bumbling, megalomaniacal leader is comical and at times thought-provoking. As I was watching the film, I drew parallels to things that I read about Hitler, and like when watching Hynkel I caught myself thinking, ""Who would follow this guy?."" Historically speaking, the film is a snapshot of the world on the brink of war. Chaplin's decision to release ""The Great Dictator"" in 1940, when the United States had not yet entered the conflict, was a courageous move. It was a call to action and a plea for the world to unite against tyranny. I think it was exactly the film that the world needed to lay the mental groundwork needed to start standing up to the looming threat of the Nazi regime. The film's closing speech, delivered by Chaplin as the Jewish barber, remains one of the most powerful moments in cinematic history, advocating for peace, democracy, and human dignity. Because of the political setting at the time of its release, you know that when Chaplin delivers his monologue, he's speaking to every single person watching the film. He was, at that moment, not playing a part in a film but begging the world for help in his moral fight. 

Chaplin's cinematic devices set this film apart from commercial movies of its time. The film seamlessly combines humor and satire with moments of genuine, tear-jerking emotion. The usage of sharp editing and Chaplin's physical comedy prowess creates a unique blend of entertainment and social commentary. The globe-balloon dance scene is a testament to Chaplin's ability to convey complex ideas through physical humor. 

When comparing ""The Great Dictator"" to Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"", you're able to draw interesting parallels in their use of cinema as a tool for social justice. While both films use humor to address issues, they do so in different contexts. ""Do the Right Thing"" explores racial tensions in a contemporary urban setting, whereas ""The Great Dictator"" tackles the timely and global issue of fascism. Both movies challenge the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about society, making them essential works in the cinematic canon. 

In conclusion, ""The Great Dictator"" remains an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of satire. Charlie Chaplin's vision and artistry shine through and deliver a timeless message of hope and humanity. This movie is essential for anyone looking for a source of inspiration, and if you don't have the time to watch the entire thing, the speech at the end is worth a YouTube search in itself.",5.0
The Great Dictator,"The film tells the story of World War I when the dictator Singer of the Kingdom came to power. His massive expansion led to constant wars and deprived the people of their livelihood. Moreover, he carried out conspiracy policies and plunged the Jewish people into dire catastrophe. Charlie, a Jewish barber who was conscripted into the army, could not escape such a high-pressure policy. When Charlie escaped from the border, he was mistaken for the dictator Zinger by the troops stationed here. He took the opportunity to make a "" Fight for Freedom"" speech.
The ignorant and cruel dictator and the kind-hearted barber with amnesia are the same character. Now of the dictator's final speech, the roles were reversed by mistake. Not only Chaplin himself longed for true change, but people with conscience also longed for: standing on the stage, wearing a mustache, a war madman with extraordinary energy, it would be great if he was a guy with kind feelings and compassion.
The film was written, directed, and acted by comedy master Charlie Chaplin. It was the first sound film created against the background of the German Nazi Party's accelerated expansion and mass murder of Jews after World War II. It was released in the United States on October 15, 1940. It satirizes the ugly acts of Hitler, the German Nazi leader, who massacred the Jews, and expresses his desire for democracy and freedom.
Chaplin's performance is very good, it can be said that it is full of passion. His nervous expressions and exaggerated movements make people watch it endlessly. It is completely different from ordinary comedies that make people want to laugh and watch twice. gimmick.
The film's supporting cast performs well. Propaganda Minister Gabezhi has a gloomy expression, is good at catering to the dictator, and plays tricks, which can be called the reappearance of the character prototype. Another heroine who is often mentioned is said to be the only character in Zhuo's works who has a sense of female autonomy, but she did not leave much impression on me.
In 1936, movies began to have sound. Later, not only sound but also color video was developed. This is Chaplin's classic work that touches on sound films. Although Chaplin once abandoned sound and entered movies, the tide of the times is irreversible, and new technologies will inevitably bring new ways of expression. It can be said that the artistic value and political value of this film have reached the highest altitude of a comedy.",5.0

The Great Dictator,"From the perspective of 2020, The Great Dictator may seem like a sure success. It was a film mocking Adolf Hitler during a period of wartime. A look at the box office returns would reveal this to be Charlie Chaplin's most commercially successful film. From this point onwards, his career would struggle.

Yet when Chaplin began work on The Great Dictator, its popularity was not assured. World War 2 had not yet began, and the British government was already offering to ban the film while they pursued an ill-advised policy of appeasement with Nazi Germany. Even by the time the film was finished, most Americans favoured staying out of the war.

What Chaplin realised was that the absurd behaviour of Adolf Hitler could easily be worked into one of his own comic characters. Chaplin drew on Triumph of the Will to mimic Hitler's mannerisms. To Chaplin, Hitler and Mussolini were posturing buffoons and ranting egomaniacs. Like their counterparts in the movie, they were little more than theatrical actors strutting around the world stage.

Chaplin also renders Hitler's speeches into a pseudo-Germanic nonsensical language that is so guttural it makes the dictator cough. The obedience of Hitler's followers does not go unnoticed. With one gesture of his hand, Chaplin's dictator cuts off their cheers and applause. It is said that Hitler himself watched The Great Dictator twice. It is hard not to wonder what he thought of it.

Charlie Chaplin had heard about the conditions of the Jewish people in Germany from friends of his, and he wished to make a stand on the issue. Amusingly enough, Chaplin himself had come in for anti-Semitic comments from the Nazis, and he was not even Jewish.

At the time, it was felt that Chaplin went too far in his portrayal of Jewish ghettos under Nazism. Nowadays, we would probably feel that he could have gone a lot further. The full horror of what was happening in Germany was not yet known, and worse was to follow as the war progressed. Later Chaplin said that he would not have made the film if he had known how bad things were in Germany.

Nonetheless Chaplin did not pull punches, and his portrayal of troopers storming through the Jewish ghetto is strangely disquieting for a comedy. The soldiers smash windows, burn down buildings, steal from Jewish traders and shoot a man who opposes them. Chaplin's character is nearly hanged from a lamp post. Concentration camps are mentioned.

The Great Dictator was the first movie that Charlie Chaplin made entirely in sound. There are moments of the old visual and slapstick humour that we associate with Chaplin ‚Äì the unexploded bomb that keeps rotating every time our hero tries to defuse it, an upside-down plane ride, and the sight of Chaplin comically out of step with his fellow soldiers, until finally he ends up walking alongside the enemy after getting lost in the fog.

Perhaps the most beautiful visual moment is one where Chaplin's dictator plays with a giant globe. The scene provides a comical take on his megalomaniacal ambitions, but it is also a brief moment of balletic elegance. Then the globe bursts, just like the tyrant's dreams.

Talking forms a greater part of Chaplin's humour for the first time though, and it must be noted that the comedy which seemed so innocent in the silent films looks a little broader here. This can be seen in the names of the leading Nazi characters. Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynkel, the somewhat less than great dictator of Tomainia (an old word for food-poisoning).

There is some discussion about whether the Jewish Barber is another incarnation of The Tramp, Chaplin's most famous creation. He is not called so, and he does have a job for much of the film. Then again, The Tramp occasionally finds work. There is at least a kinship between the two men in their basic personalities. Both have no name, both are clumsy and accident-prone, both are gallant towards women, and both are essentially kind-hearted.

The Great Dictator ends with a famous speech that divides opinions. The Jewish Barber expresses hope for a better future in terms that are rousing and idealistic, or na√Øve and sentimental, depending on your taste.

The movie stands out as a film of great courage and defiance, packed with scenes of great hilarity, and yet leavened with a serious message that resonates today.

The Great Dictator,"Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator might be cinema's most savage satire‚Ä¶and it's also very funny.  In it, Chaplin plays two roles, a Jewish barber and the incompetent fascist dictator Adenoid Hynkel, a parody of Adolf Hitler.  Considering it was released just after the start of WW2, it is a brave and powerful condemnation of fascism and the hatred that it can breed.  As with most slapstick, some of the humor misses the mark, but there are set pieces of inspired genius, among them Hynkel's dance routine with globe balloon.  The whole thing is topped off with a somber and impassioned speech from the barber, who has been mistaken as Hynkel, to an enthusiastic crowd about the evils that men do, capped off with ""in the name of democracy, let us all unite!!""  Sadly, The Great Dictator is as relevant now as it was eighty years ago.",4.5
The Great Dictator,"Pure history with great sarcasm, Charlie Chaplin's performance is undoubtedly timeless.",5.0
The Great Dictator,"The Great Dictator is, largely, an absolutely stellar film, perfect in pretty much all ways except one.  That one problem is that the movie balances outright comedic sequences against dramatic moments that are almost harrowing, and honestly, the movie's shifting between these two tones is extremely jarring and uneven, and not quite in the Citizen Kane ""it was meant to be disorientating"" kind of way.  However, I don't hold this against the movie, as both of these elements work brilliantly on their own - the harrowing moments are genuinely impactful and gripping, like a PG-precursor to Schindler's List, while the Comedic segments are genuinely on par with Duck Soup (which I would still argue to be one of the funniest films of all time).  Charlie Chaplin's portrayal of both the downtrodden little man AND the monstrous and power-mad dictator is quite a sight to behold, and his Directing of the film is genuinely great as well.",4.5
The Great Dictator,"The movie was mostly saved by the last third, when the other dictator played by Jack Oakie went on screen (with the humor that accompanied his role) and when the movie made the genius decision to switch the dictator and the Jewish barber and have him give that historic (unfortunately just for film) speech at the end. Charlie Chaplin acted, wrote, and directed the movie very well as he does with all of his productions, and while it was kind of slow and wasted time in a few parts, I'm glad that I chose to sit through it. Plus, who can't get enough of Charlie Chaplin's style of slapstick comedy??",3.5
The Great Dictator,"Speaking of Chaplin, the most memorable is probably the bread dance in the Gold Rush. Always a funny face, a grin, a clown. But do you know that he was never just a clown, hidden behind his funny mask, is a great soul. 

  

Hollywood was at its high point in the 1930s and 1940s. Many classic Hollywood films were released during this time period. ""Gone with the Wind"" (1940), a roller-coaster love story set during the American Civil War; Waterloo Bridge (1940), about a beautiful love that shocked the entire world. However, it was he who tried his hardest at the time to create The Great Dictator. On the one hand, Chaplin maintains his poor little style as a Jew who has bad luck everywhere in this film. Although it stated that it would maintain the previous style, there was a qualitative change on both the inside and outside. 

  

The first distinction is that Chaplin's first sound film was The Great Dictator. Those who have seen Chaplin's films will be impressed by his lovable and hilarious silent films, which are always in poor condition. However, Chaplin speaks for the first time in this film. If you believe that his voice will match his previous acting abilities, deliberately make a very strange, exaggerated voice, you are mistaken. Although Chaplin is the same Chaplin in this film, exaggerated and funny, it's the same recipe, but the taste is completely different. Chaplin appears to be more normal here. On stage, he was the same clown, the same burlesque. But, unlike the previous vacuum-like feeling clown, this clown has blood and flesh, pain, and feelings. The poor creature who had been hiding behind a trembling body finally spoke for the first time in ""The Great Dictator."" A staged or humorous plot, a tragic fate, or a tenacious life. Chaplin's Jewish ancestry is also worth mentioning. Hannah is the name of the film's heroine, but it is actually the name of Chaplin's mother. Hannah Chaplin, Chaplin's mother, was Jewish. However, until The Great Dictator, Chaplin never acknowledged his Jewish ancestry...  

As I previously stated, the filming and release of The Great Dictator were extremely delicate. The world of the 1930s and 1940s was in ruins. While the world was loudly celebrating the end of World War I, a man named Hitler was slowly making his way onto the stage of history. The world's situation is becoming increasingly tense, as everyone waits with bated breath for the aggressor's sword, to say nothing of him... Chaplin took the lead and created The Great Dictator. He portrays a devout Jew. Of course, we must mention his other series character, Singhal. If Charlie the Barber represents the normalization of Chaplin's drama, Singhal's character is closer to his former antics. But the wind here is funny, but always astringent enough to make you laugh out loud. Call him burlesque or artistic charm, but there is so much skill and sleight of hand here that you can't laugh. Because the hyperbole here is incredibly realistic. The lunatic, the representative of neuroticism, is fearfully fed by nearly half of the world. So, when the so-called ""upper human beings"" are absurdly leading the destruction of human nature, a clown spoke up in a corner of the world... 

  

Of course, making the film was extremely difficult. Local Francophiles wrote him anonymous letters saying that if he continued to work on the film, they would not mind killing him. Even Roosevelt, the United States' president at the time, admitted that The Great Dictator was bad for America's foreign relations. When the film was finally released, some newspapers complained that it was too long and dealt with too serious a subject. The committee also claimed that the film was an attempt to enlist America in the anti-Hitler coalition.  

Of course, if you believe there are no normal human beings in the world, then no. Halfway through the film, the United Kingdom declares war on Germany, and just when everyone believes they have won the battle, the Maginot Line is breached... The New York office immediately sent Chaplin a frantic telegram: ""Finish your film, everyone is waiting!""",5.0
The Great Dictator,"Dictator's are Never Great

	The Great Dictator was the first sound film that the legendary Charlie Chaplin ever made. Charlie Chaplin does about everything in and for this movie from directing it, to producing, to writing and even starring as two roles. Two other main roles were performed by Paulette Goddard as Hannah, and Jack Oakie as Napaloni. There is so much about this film that impressed me. From Charlie Chaplin doing almost everything, to the depiction of what a dictator really is and how dictatorship never works out, and even the funny satirical scenes that make the movie bearing to watch. The fact that Chaplin was also able to portray a picture of this dictatorship and also make the movie a comedy is just outright legendary. I also love how he played both roles of a barber and a dictator. Two completely different aspects of the game and he killed both of them. He also does such a good job of making comedy scenes out of stressful moments. The scenes like the airplane when the pilot passes out and they flip upside down but Chaplin just continues to be himself and the funny guy he is. Obviously it's a 1940's film, but I felt like it was a perfect mix of a sound film and a silent film. There's some scenes that really emulate how good Charlie Chaplin is at capturing the moment without sound, and then with sound. The best part is the end of the movie when Chaplin delivers one of the greatest speeches of all time. The film was so funny up until this point and when he starts speaking everyone just knows to tune in. The production having Chaplin be dialed into the middle of the screen gazing deep into the eyes of the audience really captures the message he's trying to convey. It's undeniably one of the best endings to a film. His tone and deliberateness deliver a message to the people who aren't fond of the world at the moment, to the people that have some doubt in themselves or what the future looks like, and Chaplin tries to bring them back up. 

	10/10. Like I said, I'm super impressed with Chaplin's ability to deliver such a well rounded film, and be a part of every single step.  His desire to deliver his message is also beautiful. He wants his audience to laugh a little, and then in the end understand the reason he decided to make the film.",5.0
Groundhog Day,"Groundhog Day is on everyone's minds thinking this movie is great much like how Ghostbusters is, even though I haven't seen Groundhog Day before, I just thought of wait for the right time to do so and then review it. But now I did, let's get this going and quit wasting time. Bill Murray is Phil Connors who is a TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney alongside Rita and Larry played by Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott, for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the ""hicks"" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job. He awakens when the song ""I Got You Babe"" playing on the clock radio. He bumps into Ned Ryerson played by Stephen Tobolowsky, and he gives his report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney. He wakes up in the morning he experiences yesterday's events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing d√©j√† vu. He realize he is now trapped in the time loop reliving the same day over and over again. He gets out of it by getting into trouble by getting himself into jail and committing suicide by getting himself blown up, electrocuted, run over by a vehicle and jumping off a building. Before seeing this movie I just had a look at the behind the scenes article between Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. The two had a falling out over at what the film should be. Bill wanted to focus on the philosophical elements and Harold wanted it to be a straight up comedy. This wasn't without their troubles going straight ahead. Bill Murray's marriage is collapsing and Harold Ramis is getting sick and tired of Bill's late night calls about script changes. The creative disagreements got so bad it led to Harold Ramis one day grabbed Bill Murray by the shirt collar and threw him against a wall. Because of this, after production on Groundhog Day ended, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis didn't speak to each other for about 20 years. And this led to the final film that the dynamic duo ever worked on. Shortly before Ramis' death, Murray came to Ramis' house early in the morning with a box of donuts and a police escort where the two had some laughs, spent a few last hours together and they both finally reconciled. Since this is the final film the two had worked on it became so memorable I don't know what to think. I know the story already before seeing this but I'm not the only one here, so yeah, that's it.",4.5

Happy Gilmore,"This film follows Happy Gilmore, a shitty hockey player who has dreams of making it to the big leagues. When his Grandma is evicted from her home for failure to pay taxes, he turns to golf in order to get the money. Here he meets a rival - Shooter McGavin, and a Woman, Virginia. Happy wins the golf open, defeating Shooter, getting the house and the girl. 

An absolutely classic movie. I'm glad I returned to it after all these years, as I forgot a fair amount and was surprised more than once by the story and comedy. I love the hockey player and golf stereotypes, as someone who is aware of both - I think they were hilarious and well done. I especially appreciate how Happy draws a non-traditional golf crowd and brings a new spirit to the sport - I've attended golf tournaments and can confirm it pretty vanilla and boring, if a player like Happy was around I would be cheering too. This movie's subtle criticism of golf and its culture is spot on for me and I think the execution was perfect, it mentions it a couple times but all within the means of the story. Personally, being a golfer and avid hockey fan - I just love the premise of the movie. 

This movie had me cracking up more than once and is just ridiculous at times. It's a truly fun watch, a movie to sit back and just enjoy - no thought, no care, nothing more than superficial characters being funny and playing golf. In terms of characters Shooter McGavin is a standout, Christopher McDonald was a genius casting choice. He's old school, pretentious and conniving - but hilarious at all the above. I played golf today and did the signature shooter celebration whenever I sunk a putt. Ben Stiller and Bob Barker are also hilarious here. 

I wanted way more of Chubbs throughout the movie. He shows up at the beginning and end but never feels like he has a significant role as Happy's coach. The love interest with Virginia is of course lacklustre as well, not to mention a conflict of interest on the tour. This movies' intention is not to focus on this of course as it's not a character or romantically driven story - but they definitely could have made it a bit more interesting without taking away from the light hearted plot. One second they go on a date the next she's best friends with Happy's mom. Again, understandably not where the writers focused their energy, but little touches in Happy's relationships would have elevated the entire thing. Good family comedys can stilll stick the landing with relationships, this just felt pretty rushed and rough. 

Overall, Happy Gilmore is an over-the-top comedy with hilarious moments and a subject matter that appeals to me. Fun from start to finish.",4.0

Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,"One of the best comedies of the late 90's-early 00's. On the surface this seems like a forgettable dumb stoner comedy and to an extent it is. But it mixes in Random Segway's, Charm, Running Gags and Clever Writing surprisingly well and the end result is a very well paced and edited stoner buddy film. The last 10-15 minutes really take the film from good to great with a charming and satisfying ending. The chemistry between Harold & Kumar is solid and with some memorable supporting performances especially Ryan Reynolds. They both have solid character arcs even as well, especially Harold. The music is not bad either with some memorable numbers but also a lot of generic ones as well. The cinematography is the biggest weak spot. It's not bad but a lot of the gags aren't visual as much as verbal and a lot of the time their just riding on the highway in the dark and its forgettable, along with basic camerawork. The jokes work about 75% of the time and get a good laugh every now and then with consistent chuckles in between. What makes a lot of the jokes work is they have a dark sharp edge to them which I didn't expect. It's also a very versatile mix of humor as well and sometimes it doesn't work. While other times it doesn't work but than than surprises and makes you laugh which is very rare in this type of genre and era. Honestly anyone who is a fan of any of the actors in this, comedies or films of this time period should give this a watch. It's A Classic Stoner comedy and the best one I've seen.",4.5

It may be due to nostalgia or maybe it's because it's one of the few movies my father and I watched together when he was still alive. But I will always find this movie to have a beautiful message at the end. Throughout the movie, you follow these characters and you watch them grow. You watch how much Maude affects Harold and causes him to change and value his life much more than he used to. Because of Maude, Harold learned the meaning of life. It shows how we're all different, have vastly different stories, yet we find each other somehow and learn from each other. My favorite line from this movie is Maude when she says ""Go out and love some more."" That line cuts deeply. This movie isn't suitable for anyone, but if you enjoy dark comedy, please watch it.",5.0

Harold and Maude,"Harold and Maude is a dark comedy that has become a cult classic for good reason.  It's smart, extremely well-acted, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Though it was a failure at the box office when it was released in 1971, this film has gone on to gain much deserved acclaim and recognition.  

Harold (Bud Cort) is a young man of wealth, obsessed with suicide and death.  He spends enormous amounts of energy with staging suicide attempts, much to the exasperation of his mother, Mrs. Chasen (played to detached perfection by Vivian Pickles).  Her typical response when finding Harold hanging from a ceiling or cut up on a closet floor is merely one of annoyance.  A scene where she engages in a morning swim (accompanied by Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1) as she nonchalantly completes laps around Harold's ""drowned"" body is hysterical.  Most of her time in the film is spent as the conduit for arranging possible dates for Harold, something she thinks will assist him in life.   Harold turns each of her perspective date interviews into a spectacle of antics.

When Harold isn't planning or staging ways to play out his demise, he likes to spend time attending funerals.  It is at one of these funerals that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordan), an eccentric 79-year-old woman who lives life on her own terms, with little care for standard social boundaries or regulations.  She believes that one should experience something new every day, and she's more than willing to bend the rules of social norms to achieve that goal.  Her joie de vivre is one that Harold is unaccustomed to and something that excites and invigorates him.  The two begin to spend more and more time together, until their friendship eventually becomes romantically emotional and physical.  Neither caring that their relationship would be considered taboo by most others.   

Maude ultimately determines that embracing life for all it has to offer must also include accepting death as well.  Unfolding events leave Harold forced to finally make the ultimate decision of whether he wants to fully embrace the death he has obsessed over, or to embrace the life that Maude has unveiled to him.

At its core, the film is one of presenting contrasts‚Ä¶ life and death; young and old; fullness and emptiness; color (Maude's deserted train car home) and dull (Harold's mansion home); simplicity and complexity (a daisy or a field of daisies).  The cinematography, set in and around the San Francisco area is gorgeous, and the music and costuming firmly cement the film to the nineteen-seventies.  Most of the film features original songs written and performed by Cat Stevens.  Watching this movie was like enjoying a little time-capsule of celluloid, intended to simply remind any viewer of any time period that life is precious, fleeting, and what one chooses to make of it.  It may well have been produced ahead of its time, but it has more than caught up‚Ä¶ or we have.",5.0

Harold and Maude,"When Harold (Bud Cort), a wealthy young man obsessed with death, meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an elderly woman obsessed with life, his life is changed for ever as their unique friendship gradually evolves into an even more unique romance.  While Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude may not be worthy of the cult following that it has, it remains an entertaining and inspiring story of life and love.  Not without its faults (Harold's antics grow tiring, some interior shots are weirdly framed, a lot of the attempts at comedy are overdone), it is buoyed by a knockout performance from Gordon, a great soundtrack from Cat Stevens, a totally original storyline, and a great vibe that can't help but make you feel really friggin' good.",3.5
Harold and Maude,"A dark delight with a striking warmth.

Hal Ashby's black comedy romance drama Harold and Maude (1971) is a peculiar film with a multi-faceted style I enjoyed very much. It's very much a black comedy with morbid humor as Harold is a young man who wants to kill himself and you see him attempt various forms of faked suicides, and it's hilarious every time. John A. Alonzo shoots with a wide shot, so you can see all the suicide recreations and quirky dates Harold and Maude undertake.

Hal Ashby's direction deftly balances these otherwise dreary scenes into an upbeat comedy that is ultimately life affirming. Harold meets Maude, an older lady and develops a true fondness for her as she has fun with Harold and gets him to slowly start to appreciate living. There are heartfelt moments and absurd car chases to funny funerals. I was laughing at the ridiculous jokes, thinking about the existential crisis these two are having, while finding solace in their peaceful conclusion. Harold and Maude is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made.

Writer Colin Higgins wrote quite a brilliant script. You get to know the estranged and absurd relationship between Harold and his indifferent and frustrated mother. Vivian Pickles is hilarious as Harold's mother Mrs. Chasen as she arranges several dates for Harold, yet she's really ignoring him. Higgins' writing lets you know Harold feels depressed and neglected by his shallow mother as she can only think of his marriage as leading to his happiness or normalcy. Bud Cort is a young and interesting actor as he looks younger than he is as Harold Parker Chasen, while also conveying Harold's inner sadness naturally. He's quite good.

Ruth Gordon is hilarious and delightful as the exuberant Maude. You see how she loves life and plays around with stealing cars and trees to speed down the highway, taking every opportunity to have fun like skidding around corners at top speed. She's a treat to watch as she always feels genuine and kind, if insane at all times. Editors William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka cut quickly for a fast pace for 91 minutes like these car chase segments. 

I love when Tom Skerritt's highway patrol cop stops her in disbelief and dismay. It's a funny cameo. I liked director Hal Ashby's cameo at the amusement park with his distant stare and enormous beard. Cyril Cusack cameos as an artist doing a nude painting of Maude, while Charles Tyner portrays Ashby's anti-war sentiments and those of the hippies with his gung ho for war general. As he raves about the benefits of warfare and the military, you cannot help but notice wounded veterans, including Tyner with one arm that can only salute his nation with a missing arm. I enjoyed Ellen Geer's shallow actress Sunshine with her weird performance. Isn't she just perfect for Harold? Lastly, Eric Christmas' Priest character is a riot with his disapproval and disgust for Maude..

William Ware Theiss' costumes look just like stylish hippie suits and patterns, which fits 1971 perfectly. Cat Stevens' gentle folk songs adorn Harold and Maude with a bittersweet warmth and a musical calm at all times. You feel Cat Stevens adding a melancholy, yet his songs also sound happy or content with life in a way. Bob Stein's make-up ensures everyone looks dead and pale, especially Harold.

In all, Harold and Maude is all you need.",5.0

Heathers,"That made me just a little bit uncomfortable. Looking at the trailer, I thought it would be more humorous, but it just turned out dark and depressing. I suspect the movie is supposed to make you feel this way to get across the message that teenagers are messed up, but I think it took it too far. First of all, there's the emotional and physical manipulation of Veronica by her boyfriend JD, and there's the unsensitivity of suicide. If you want a movie with the same message but less troubling, try Mean Girls. JD is literally a terrorist. Also, the conflict could have been solved if Veronica had just called 911, instead of trying to take matters into her own hands.",1.5

His Girl Friday,"The expression that comes to mind when I think about His Girl Friday is ""fast-talking"". This is not a mere impression, and it is not an accident. In making the film, the director Howard Hawks was deliberately aiming for that effect.

His Girl Friday was the second film adaptation of a 1920s comedy called The Front Page. The first film version supposedly had the record for the fastest dialogue delivery on screen, and Hawks was trying to beat that record. Hawks' use of overlapping dialogue and a sound mixer intended to increase the speed of the actor's speeches had the desired effect.

It is said that His Girl Friday has an average count of 240 words spoken per minute, considerably faster than normal human speech. This gives the movie the feel of being a musical without music ‚Äì one in which the rhythm is contained within the speech. Sometimes the banter slows down. Sometimes there is silence. Much of the time it pours out rapidly, and repeated viewings of the film are necessary to follow all of verbal exchanges.

However His Girl Friday was not a tightly planned technical exercise in moviemaking. It was a comedy, and Hawks wanted a spontaneous effect. Actors were encourage to ad-lib and improvise. Admittedly some of that ad-libbing was planned by individual actors too, but it led to a number of unexpected jokes.

Actors break the fourth wall and address the screen. Cary Grant makes self-referential jokes, suggesting that Ralph Bellamy's character looks like the actor Ralph Bellamy, and making allusions to a man called Archie Leach (Grant's real name). Camera work is fluid too. At the beginning the camera tracks along the office, showing the bustle and murmur of the pressroom. Despite most of the action taking place in one or two sets, there is never the feeling that we are watching a stage play.

The story is a simple enough one. The action takes place in and around the pressrooms connected to The Morning Post, a newspaper whose output is controlled by its editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Walter's ex-wife Hildy (Rosalind Russell) is planning to give up journalism and settle down with amiable sap, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy).

However Walter has not given up hope of sabotaging the engagement and winning back his former wife. When the unfairly convicted Earl Williams (John Qualen) escapes from the prison where he is awaiting execution, Hildy soon forgets her plans for retirement and marriage, as she is caught up in reporting the story.

The behaviour of the two characters in relation to one another, and in relation to those around them, makes for some interesting sexual politics. One of the main changes between the 1931 film The Front Page and this 1940 adaptation is that the character of Hildy Johnson received a sex change in this version.

Howard Hawks is said to have made this decision during auditions when his secretary read the lines of Hildy Johnson, and Hawks liked the way they sounded when delivered by a woman.  I suspect we may need to take this story with a grain of salt. The more likely reason was to add a little romance, and improve the film's commercial appeal.

There is no doubt though that the decision to make Hildy a woman proved to be an inspired one. Her personality reflects this gender change, but in ways that make the film more interesting. Rosalind Russell was not the first choice for the role, but on reflection she was the best actress possible ‚Äì someone who could seem tough and abrasive, but who was capable of occasional softer moments.

Howard Hawks was a conservative director, and this is clear from His Girl Friday. Like many comedies of the age, the husband and wife must come together at the end of the story, even if they have been divorced. The sanctity of marriage is re-established. Hawks also has no time for weak sentiment or expression of feeling.

Nonetheless Hawks had a great admiration for strong, feisty women, and Hildy Johnson anticipated many of the heroines of Hawks' later movies, such as To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep and Rio Bravo. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why His Girl Friday seems so modern, and endures well.

His Girl Friday,"You'll need subtitles just to catch all the fast talking, transatlantic, double talk. 

Director Howard Hawks' romantic comedy His Girl Friday (1940) is very humorous, but also kind of too chaotic to even make sense. The entire movie is every character yelling over one another in hectic double talk sequences. Hawks' direction looks fine, but I found myself horribly lost in the pointless side stories and not really enjoying the stressful double talk and randomly serious drama that critiques unethical journalists that just lie for headlines. 

His Girl Friday wants to be a smart satire, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, and earnest melodrama and so it only accomplishes all of these to a moderate extent. It's too cluttered. The simultaneous conversations seems like a neat gag, but when it's the only real joke, His Girl Friday failed to make me belly laugh until Billy Gilbert's Joe Pettibone character showed up. His Girl Friday felt longer than 92 minutes, honestly.

It's sort of funny as writers Charles Lederer and Ben Hecht's script is clever and full of wit. But the endless talking around matters is obnoxious and incredibly hard to follow. The charismatic performances bring all this stream of conscious dialogue to life. His Girl Friday is not very romantic as Cary Grant is practically the villain, manipulating his ex-wife into getting back together with him in a relationship and at work. I found Grant's character sexist and overbearing like his only redeeming quality is that he's Cary Grant. 

Cary Grant is excellent as Walter Burns, but I don't like seeing Grant as a sexist newspaper editor. He's casually cruel and manipulative with his endless lies and deceptions. He is fun, but Grant is better as the nice everyman rather than a fast talking con man. Everyone talks quickly with Grant's same Transatlantic accent, so Grant doesn't even stand out vocally as much as normal.
 
Rosalind Russell is charming, but gullible herself as Hildy Johnson. I feel like she's introduced as a smart independent woman, but she gives up her family life and fiancee for a man that treats her terribly. If all she wanted was a career, that's fine, but Grant gives her no reason to fall in love as they're barely on screen together. Ralph Bellamy is fun as a completely gullible fool named Bruce Baldwin. He's almost too stupid to believe. Abner Biberman is fun as the con artist and thief Louie.

John Qualen is touching as the wrongly convicted death row escapee Earl Williams. He's far too sincere for a comedy as these serious scenes drag the tone and pace down considerably. Helen Mack is shockingly moving as Mollie Malloy out of nowhere. She's the only person that cares about the man about to be wrongly sentenced to death. Billy Gilbert is hilarious as Joe Pettibone, who delivers the pardon of the criminal. His boisterous laugh and charming personality are very funny as the clueless fool. He elevates the film considerably.

Gene Havlick's editing could have cut this down into something slicker. It's fairly slowly paced for how much talking takes place and how short His Girl Friday is actually. Joseph Walker's shots are pretty flat as it looks like a play rather than a dynamic film. It's all wide shots with a few choice close-ups and medium shots to freshen things up. I thought the camera held too long in the same place to really hold my attention. 

Composers Sidney Cutner, Felix Mills, and Ben Oakland wrote a fairly forgettable score that's slightly lively, I suppose? Lodge Cunningham impressively mixes all the voices together so that you can clearly hear what each person is saying despite them talking over one another. Robert Kalloch gives Rosalind Russell a crazy patterned suit and Cary Grant a neat tailored suit. Everyone else has regular suits of the era.

In all, I am a bit disappointed by His Girl Friday. It is funny, but not nearly as hysterical as it should have been.",3.0

I really don't think it would work even at 75% speed. It was a fun little story and Rosalind Russell's character really was something special for a movie made in 1940. I loved the gender politics in the film and the matter-of-fact dark comedy worked really well.

The comedic elements come from a pretty good script from Charles Lederer but it's the performances from both leads that ignite the film. 

The narrative shifts back and forward and the tone is interesting as the film progresses. It's a good film at a satisfactory length too. 

One of Grants best. Definitely recommend.",4.0
His Girl Friday,"Grant and Russell invest in their roles and provide a few brilliant moments, but this romantic comedy coasts on charms and fast dialogue to cover up the uninteresting conflict not pertaining to the main character's relationships. It seems that the filmmakers and actors sought to show off more than anything else in order to deliver speed rather than thoughtfulness. Grant's character is a charming scumbag and much of the film seems antiquated and aged rather than timeless. The screenplay weakens in the second half as it focuses on tying up the plot rather than offering the amusing quips in high volume earlier on. His Girl Friday is a decent time-killer, but not one that modern audiences are particularly missing out on.",3.0
His Girl Friday,"Packed full of incredibly fast-paced dialogue, characters constantly speaking over one another, and an incredibly charming performance from Grant, His Girl Friday is probably one of the greatest romantic comedy classics that isn't really part of pop culture mainstream these days. There is always something happening, though Hawks dedicates a surprising amount of time towards darker moments that haven't seeped into the film's reputation - criticisms of the police and judicial systems, and particularly the press and yellow journalism (a woman literally attempts suicide due to the mischaracterizations of a group of backroom wordsmiths, and it stops the film dead with sobriety for a moment). The plot is convoluted, but that's part of the point - that Grant's Walter would go to such bizarre lengths to create the opportunity to preserve his relationship with Hildy (Russell), as faking phone calls gradually escalates to harboring a convicted killer. The fast-paced dialogue and consistent one-liners and brisk jokes often make this film seem like a slightly more fleshed out, romantic version of a Marx Brothers film, though championed by a magnetic performance from a single actor rather than a trio. Funny, short, and distinctive, His Girl Friday is still an absolute must see for both fans of classic film and those just looking for some entertainment value. (4/5)",4.0
His Girl Friday,The cycle of abuse in black and white still hold up today. This movie does a great job painting manipulation as romantic. The news paper guy moves about in an amusing manor tho so that was a laugh. Good dialogue. Very Gilmore girls.,3.0

Hot Fuzz,"It's a good half-hour too long, and - like Wright's later Baby Driver, overblown, but the good outweighs the less good, helped by a huge helping of A-list support performances and a daft script delivered with hilarious solemnity. If Sam Peckinpah had directed an Ealing comedy it would have looked like this.",4.0
Hot Fuzz,"Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's very own ""Super Cop"" He is the best of the best, the ultimate over-achiever, ""the cop that can't be stopped""... He is so good, he is making his colleagues look really bad. 
  ""You've been making us all look bad"" - Chief Inspector 
   So the force promotes him to sergeant and reassigns him to the small sleepy village town Sandford... the most crime free town in the whole country!
   Angel is reduced from the big city violence and high crime to recovering escaped swans.
    But then there is a car accident. Two lovers killed, decapitated, their heads found near the car. . But is it really a accident. Then there are even more ""accidents""...all resulting in deaths.  But Angel is convinced that these are not accidents.This is murder.
   ""Yeah, accidents happen all the time. What makes you think it was MURDER?"" - Doris
   ""Have you ever wondered why the crime rate in Sandford is so low, yet the accident rate is so high?"" - Angel
     Wow! ""By the power of Greyskull""  What a fun popcorn movie!  Simon Pegg is so awesome as super cop Angel, and there is a lot of action and a really great cast of actors. The story is fast paced and well-written, maybe a bit bizarre for some, but so clever with a lot of dry and subtle humor.... And that never stops all through the movie.  
   I like that Hot Fuzz spoofs a lot of Hollywood action flicks, but still takes itself very serious... in a British kind of way. Just absolutely brilliant!
Note - There are some gruesome murder scenes. 
   Cast -  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Olivia Colman, Timothy Dalton, David Bradley",5.0
Hot Fuzz,It is a truly great execution of the very genre it is parodying. Calling it a parody might actually not be fair. It's a loving tribute with satire and jokes that land every time!,5.0
Hot Fuzz,"Not sure how this has an RT critics rating of 91% and 89% from the audience. I really wanted to watch a funny, wacky comedy tonight, expecting this to be some ripper of a farce. Instead, it's more like a farce of a ripper. For me, Pegg just doesn't work as the uptight type-A copper who's the butt of the jokes. 
The whole 1st half hour I laughed maybe twice. Wasn't even funny under the, er, influence. Ay? Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Then there's the several jump cuts of images. flashing lights, and blaring noise I found unnerving and pointless. But then the movie found its legs and went walkabout to worthiness.
The 2nd half or so is pretty funny. The comic writing works better after establishing the characters, and Nick Frost knows how to say funny things, but also how to say things funny. He carries so much of what works here. Considine and Spall are a good pairing and make the most of their screen time. 
Plus, hell, Jim Broadbent, Olivia Colman, Bill Bailey, and Timothy Dalton doing what he does best. And I was pretty sure that was Cate Blanchett. This is the 3rd movie by Wright & Pegg I've seen, and it's pretty par for the course; esp. if you throw in another Pegg comedy, ""Paul"". They're worth a watch, but I'm not excited to watch them again any time soon. But ""World's End"" stands out for me. 
This one? three stars",3.0
Hot Fuzz,"The is a great film and a perfect comedy! Hot Fuzz has it all; hilarious comedy, cool action setpieces, fun characters and a great plot. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return as the comedic duo and give their best performances. The supporting cast is excellent, with every actor pulling off their characters well and nailing their comedy moments. If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead then you should love this just as much, and if you haven't seen SOTD yet then I highly recommend that one next.",5.0

Hot Fuzz,Well thought out and super entertaining. The shot composition and fast editing give Hot Fuzz a thrillingly fast pace and the many clever jokes per minute work very well with this. I also love the movie's central mystery - it's super well-handled. The cast is fun in general and the comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfect in the leading roles. I think the ending is a little weaker than the rest of the movie but it hardly matters.,4.5
Hot Fuzz,"So many 'comedies' lack a secret ingredient these days; that being humour. You get 20 mins into a film and think when does this get funny. Of the trilogy this is the best one with belly laughs every few sentences. If comedy is this easy, why are there so many duds released? This film has a constant flow of action, humour and great chemistry between Pegg and Frost. Hugely quotable and can be watched over and over without wearing you out.",5.0

Watching this film, I found myself laughing out loud more often than any other film in recent memory. The film has memorable and quotable moments from start to finish.

Hot Rod,"People tend to compare this movie to Jackass and call it a ripoff or if they didnt like Jackass they call this another Jackass. However, Andy Samberg does what he does best in this movie play a goofy offbeat character with some slapstick involved. This move may not be a tour de force but the comedy is classic and there are many laughs.",5.0
Hot Rod,"Andy Samberg, lights of the screen in his film debut as the bumbling stunt boy becoming a man. Silly, quirky, off-the-wall humor with great sight gags , including a dance, Lampone of footloose, with possibly the funniest fall ever in the history of movies. Boggles the mind that so many people don't get this film. Rod and his crew are here for your entertainment. 
If you like the original, dumb and dumber and the three stooges, there's a very good chance you'll love this film. Grab your popcorn and enjoy the silliness. Oh yeah, and the fight scenes with the dad are hysterical.",4.0

Hot Rod,"Summary:
	Hot Rod tells the story of Rod Kimble, a young man who does dangerous stunts for fun, following the example of his deceased father, a stuntman who passed away in a motorcycle accident many years ago. These events happen in the 1990's, in the United States of America, in a peaceful neighborhood where Rod lives with his mother, his stepbrother, and his stepfather Frank. He and Frank have a complicated relationship since Rod feels the need to obtain Frank's love and approval by beating him in a fist fight but has never been able to do so. One day, Rod comes home after a failed stunt to discover that Frank has a heart condition that requires him to get a transplant, but the family does not have enough money to pay for the surgery; to collect donations and help cover the costs of Frank's operation, Rod decides that he will perform an impressive stunt that has never been done before: he will jump over 15 buses with his moped. This is not an easy task, and he encounters many challenges and difficulties as he trains and prepares for the big jump. With the help and support of his friends, Rod secures sponsorship from a local radio station and is finally ready to attempt his most important stunt. Succeeding means being able to raise the $50,000 needed for the heart transplant; failing means he may never get a chance to beat his stepfather in a fair fight, so there is no room for error if Rod wants to finally gain Frank's full recognition and respect.

Analysis:
	This movie is essentially about love, and how it is manifested in the family and in healthy friendships. It tells us that family relationships are extremely valuable, so we should love and take care of each other. An example of this is that despite their rocky relationship, Rod is devastated once he learns of Frank's illness, and he does everything in his power to help him recover, showing him that he loves him. To illustrate the importance of friendship, we see that after Rod's initial failures, all of his friends encourage him. They remind him the reasons why he does what he does, they offer him unconditional support, and help him get back on his feet to complete his big stunt.
Determination is central to the message of the movie as well. Rod is not a great stuntman at the beginning of the story, and most people make fun of him. He even learns something about his biological father that initially made him change his mind about becoming a stuntman, but he keeps going against all adversity to get the money for Frank's surgery. A visual artifact that the movie uses a lot to represent determination is a fake mustache that Rod wears during stunts. I interpret this motif as a way of showing him ""being a man"" and being resolved to complete the challenge in front of him. In one of the final scenes, we see that Rod starts growing an actual mustache, showing that he is becoming a ""real"" man after all the things he learned.

Critique/Recommendation:
	I love this movie; I think it does a great job at showing Rod's perseverance and makes good use of physical elements and action sequences to show it, for example, the setting up of ramps and other props for his stunts, the use of his moped, the extensive planning and training for the big jump, the strong resolution to get back up every time he crashes, etc. One of its only weaknesses is that during some scenes, the over-the-top humor can get in the way of trying to convey specific messages, but this is not such a big deal considering it is a comedy, and the overall themes are still clear as long as the viewers keep the big picture in mind. I have seen it multiple times, and I have had a lot of fun every single time, so I rate it 5/5 stars and highly recommend it.",5.0

Hot Rod,What a dumb movie. Now don't get me wrong was it hilariously funny? Kinda. It's funny at some parts but overall this movie is absurd and makes no sense. But I have to put some respect on this movie because the movie doesn't take itself seriously at all. So I have to applaud that. But overall this predictable coming of age story about a motorcycle stuntman who has to raise money to save his step dad only to beat him up. Me writing that right now it sounds absurd which it is. In the end this movie is funny but very dumb and unfortunately I'm already forgetting about it. You can tell that the lonely island crew was having some dumb fun and I felt like this movie is very experimental and the lonely island back then were still refining their craft. You can tell the huge upgrade we got with Popstar never stop stopping. But in the end hot rod is funny but in the dumb popcorn throwaway kind of way.,3.0
